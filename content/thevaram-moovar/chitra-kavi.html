Chitra Kavi are one of the great accomplishments of Tamil poetry. They push the bounds of creativity. A beautiful example where the letters form a picture is shown on the left. Let's take a look at some of Sambandar's poems in this genre. 

<div class = "big-center"><b>Maalai Maatru</b></div>
One of Sambandar’s more famous feats is his Maalai Maatru (Maalai – garland), so named as the poem is a series of 11 couplets each in the form of a garland, since it can be read left to right or right to left and still produce the same poem. 

This makes it a palindrome. Like the Kantar Antati it sounds unintelligible at first and proves to be extremely difficult to split the couplets into its root word. The couplets increase in difficulty as they progress and showcase the extremely succinct nature of Tamil:

<b>Verse 1:</b>
யாமாமாநீ யாமாமா யாழீகாமா காணாகா
காணாகாமா காழீயா மாமாயாநீ மாமாயா

<b>Transliteration:</b>
yAmAmAnI yAmAmA yAzhIkAmA kANAkA
kANAkAmA kAzhIyA mAmAyAnI mAmAyA

<b>Word-by-word separation:</b>
yAm AmA nI Am Am mAyAzhI kAmA kAN nAkA
kAnA kAmA kAzhIyA mAmAyA nI mA mAyA

<b>Meaning:</b>
yAM AmA nI Am Am – Would it be right for souls like us to think highly of ourselves? That would only be right for You
mAyAzhI – He who plays the great harp
kAmA – He who is beloved by all
kAN nAkA – He who can be seen ornamented with snakes
kANA kAmA – He who destroyed the God of Lust 
kAzhIyA – He who rules over the city of SeekAzhi
mAmAyA – He who is skilled in conducting illusions
nI – You (free us)
mA – from the black veil (which is a result of one’s ignorance)
mAyA – of illusion

As always one of the more interesting verses of Sambandar’s compositions is the 8th verse, in which he praises the devotion of Ravanan. Ravanan is usually portrayed as a 10 headed evil king who committed many atrocities before being slain by Rama, an avatar of Vishnu. 

However, the Saiva poets avoided this pattern of extensively demonising Ravana for the purpose of praising Rama. Sambandar in particular extolled his extreme devotion, his valour and his knowledge of both music as well as the scripture. An example can be seen in the maalai maatru too:

<b>Verse 8:</b>
நேணவராவிழ யாசைழியே வேகதளேரிய ளாயுழிகா    
காழியுளாயரி ளேதகவே யேழிசையாழவி ராவணனே

kAzhiyuLAyari LEthakavE yEzhisaiyAzhavi rAvaNanE

<b>Word-by-word separation:</b>
nE Anavar A vizha yA Asai izhiyE vEgam athaL Eri aLAya uzhi kA
kAzhiyuLa aru izhavu Ethu agavE Ezhisai yAzha rAvaNAnE

<b>Meaning:</b>
nE ANavar – Devotees who possess love for you
A – as the soul
vizha – falls losing its nature
yA – the tied rope
Asai – of desire
izhiyE – is untied by Him
athaL Eri – He beautifully adorns the hide
vEgam – of the fast animal.
aLaya uzhi – From the place where sadness prevails
kA – You must protect us
kAzhiyuLA – Ruler of Seekazhi
aru izhavu Ethu agavE – You graciously forgave that great crime of Ravanan
Ezhisai yAzha – as he delighted you by playing the harp

<div class = "big-center"><b>Ekapadam</b></div>
This is the most extreme version of the concept of yamakam present in the Kantar Antati. Here every line of a song is completely identical, yet when the individual words are separated from the seers, they all stand completely different in meaning. 

It is incredibly difficult to both compose and to read. Sambandar’s poem pirama purathurai is an example of such, it is a collection of 12 songs which all follow this extremely strict rule:

<b>Verse 4:</b>
விளங்கொளி திகழ்தரு வெங்குரு மேவினன்	
விளங்கொளி திகழ்தரு வெங்குரு மேவினன்	
விளங்கொளி திகழ்தரு வெங்குரு மேவினன்	
விளங்கொளி திகழ்தரு வெங்குரு மேவினன்

<b>Word-by-word separation:</b>
விளம் கொளி தி கழ்தரு எங்கு உரு மேவினன்
விளங்கு ஒளி தி கழ்தரு எங்கு உருமு ஏவினன்
விள் அங்கு ஒளிது இகழ்தரு எம் குரு மேவினன்
விளங்கு ஒளி திகழ்தரு வெங்குரு மேவின

<b>Meaning:</b>
Sivan accepted Kannan, the avataram of Vishnu who slayed the demons disguised as calf and as tree. He takes the form of thunder and is frightful to those that engage in evil deeds. 

He graced me with wisdom such that I could find release from the spiral of life and death, and as a Guru allowed me to become one with him. 

He was also the preceptor of the Lord of Death who gained his powers only after ardently worshipping Sivan, who presides over the city of Venguru.  

<div class = "big-center"><b>Mozhi Maatru</b></div>
The mozhi maatru is an interesting exercise first handled by Sambandar. It involves composing a poem, while ensuring that the metre and other such requirements are kept intact, but intentionally writing so that the words must be rearranged to make any sense of the meaning. 

An example is shown here, with the rearranged version beneath:
<b>Verse:</b>
காடது அணிகலம் கார் அரவம் பதி காலதனில்
தோடது அணிகுவர் சுந்தரக் காதினில் தூச்சிலம்பர்
வேடது அணிவர் விசயற்கு உருவம் வில்லும் கொடுப்பர்
பீடது அணிமணி மாடப் பிரபுரத்து அரரே

<b>Rearranged version:</b>
காடது பதி கார் அரவம் அணிகலம் காலதனில்
தூச்சிலம்பர் சுந்தரக் காதினில் தோடது அணிகுவர் 
வேடது உருவம் அணிவர் விசயற்கு வில்லும் கொடுப்பர்
பீடது அணிமணி மாடப் பிரபுரத்து அரரே

Meaning:
He is the Lord who resides in the forests, who decorates his chest with black snake. On his feet he wears pristine anklets, and wears woman’s earring on his beautiful ear. 

He wears the disguise of hunter and graced the famous warrior Arjunan with his bow. He is the King of Piramapuram, where there are high mansions decked with gems.

Now compare to what the meaning of the unarranged version would be. Sivan is adorned with forests and lives in snakes. He wears earring on his foot and anklet on his ear and so on!!
