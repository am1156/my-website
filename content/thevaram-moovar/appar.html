Appar is more formally known as Thirunavukkarasar (King of speech as navu – usually tongue – is more appropriately translated to speech). '

He was a contemporary of Sambandar, who was the one who fondly named him Appar (Father) when the two interacted. He is typically placed as living between 570 – 650 CE. 

He was orphaned in his youth and raised by his sister, Thilakavathiar, a devout Saiva. Unlike her, Appar turned to Jainism and spent many years studying and practising the religion. After some time, he was afflicted by a serious stomach pain. 

When none of the Jain medicines worked, he returned home, where Thilakavathiar smeared the holy ash on him and taught him the five syllable mantra of Saivism (namaccivAya). 

He is said to have spontaneously composed his first verse during a visit to a Siva temple, and by the time he finished the tenth verse, his stomach ache miraculously stopped. 

From that moment he became a devout Saiva, angering the Jain monks who tried many methods of persecuting him. These included tying him to a rock and throwing him into the water or burying him neck-deep and letting loose an elephant to trample him, but he emerged completely unharmed from every trial. 

He spent his life singing on various shrines and pilgriming to various temples where he would do thondu (services) such as clearing the surroundings of weeds and grasses. For this reason, he is pictured with a gardening hoe in hand.
