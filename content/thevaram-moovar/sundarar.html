Sundarar (the beautiful one) also named Sundaramoorthi, is quite different from the other two members of the Tevaram Trinity. He is depicted as a well attired, regal young man holding a lotus in one hand, and sometimes accompanied by his two wives. 

According to the Periya Puranam, he is said to have lived in the celestial world, as a friend of Siva, when for an instant he glanced upon two maidens while picking flowers for worship. 

Since desire leads to rebirth, Siva sent him to live in the mortal world and experience married life with these two women, but unbeknownst to Sundarar, there was an ulterior motive behind Siva’s plan. 


The rest of his story is supported by many autobiographical references in his poetry. He was born in the late 7th century making him the youngest of the trinity. Upon being adopted he was afforded a luxurious childhood, and after he came of age a marriage was arranged. 

During the marriage ceremony a strange old man approached and produced a document saying that Sundarar was bound by it to serve him. Sundarar chases him calling him a pitthan (madman) and tears the document. 

The man however proclaims that to be a replica and brings out the original for review by the town’s elders, who find the document to be authentic. Sundarar is then bound as his slave to everyone’s surprise. 

The congregation ask the man who he is, to which he leads them to the temple and disappears into the shrine of Siva, revealing his identity as Siva himself. Sundarar thus becomes a devout slave of Siva and sang of him at various shrines. 

When he was in Thiruvarur he met and became enamoured of Paravai, a dancer at the temple, who became his first wive. 

His second marriage happened in Thiruvottriyur, to a nun named Cankili, under the condition that he must never leave the borders of the city, as Cankili feared he would leave her for his first wive. 

After some time, Sundarar wasn’t able to keep his promise, and left to go see Paravai again. As punishment Siva took away his eyesight, and as a blind man he composed a fraction of his poetry begging for Siva to forgive him. 

Eventually he regained his eyesight, but when he returns to Thiruvarur, Paravai refuses to accept him, until Siva himself acts as messenger for Sundarar and convinces Paravai to forgive him, a story which is beautifully and humorously recounted in the Periya Puranam. 

His story has an epilogue befitting the prologue. At just 18 years old he is said to have reached heaven riding atop a white elephant in a royal procession towards Kailasa mountain the abode of Siva (refer to the 7.100 thevaram in the following section).

The ultimate reason for Sundarar’s birth is also recounted in the Periya Puranam, although many of the details were added posthumously. Once when he was walking in towards the Thiruvarur temple he walked past the devotees sitting at the entrance. 

One of the seated people was Viralmindar Nayanar, who was an ardent devotee of Sivan’s slaves – believing them to be the manifestation of Siva himself. Therefore, he took exception to Sundarar not bowing to the other seated devotees before heading in. 

However, when questioned, Sundarar refused to give in and the enraged Viralmindar resorted to chasing him with an axe. When Viralmindar had caught up to Sundarar and had him at arm’s reach, Siva hid Sundarar by allowing him to disappear inside the temple wall. 

To avenge Sundarar’s action and Lord Siva’s favouritism, Viralmindar excommunicated them both from Saiva worship! To appease Viralmindar, Siva instructed Sundarar to sing the praises of all the great Saiva devotees, which he did so in the thiruthondar thogai, which later become the crux for the thiruthondar anthati authored by Nambi Andar Nambi, and the Periya Puranam itself of Sekkizhar.
