The Tevaram along with the Thiruvasagam are the heart and soul of Saiva poetry. The Tevaram in particular are vibrant and optimistic – a complete renunciation of all that is external to Siva and a celebration of the Lord’s compassion and glory. 

The Tevaram poets vary quite a bit in style, Sambandar is the trailblazing prolific child prodigy who handles complicated poetic grammars with ease. 

Appar is the introspective and tender poet who quite often deals with the guilt he feels at having been a Jain monk in his earlier life. His poetry is quite emotional and intimate, while at the same time we can find an energising surrender to the Lord. 

Sundarar is playfully dubbed as the Rude Devotee (vanthondar) by Siva himself, and lives up to the name, as he swings from light-hearted mockery of the God to treating him with a sense of familiarity as if exploiting their friendship, to wondering at the grace of the Lord and his own utter worthlessness. 

Selected verses are presented here: I provide the name of the poet, the number of the Thirumurai as well as the pathigam and verse number.

<b>Sambandar 1.1 Verse 1</b>
<em>Studded ear, crowned with pristine white moon –  
Rider of the Bull who smears himself with ash 
from the cemetery ground, thief who stole my heart!
when Brahma, seated on lotus, 
bowed down in worship
he was graced by the Lord
who resides in the great city of Piramapuram</em>

<b>Appar 5.90 Verse 1</b>
<em>Like the lute’s pure melody
	and the evening moon,
like gentle breeze
	and springtime bliss,
like the hum of bees 
	in flowery pond
is the shade
	of my Father’s Feet</em>

The very first song sung by Sundarar (recall his life history). The last line seems to affirm the story of how he gained a birth on the Earth, after living in Kailai Mountain.

<b>Sundarar 7.1 Verse 1</b>
<em>Madman! crowned with crescent moon,
Great One, full of grace
You have placed yourself in my mind
such that I meditate upon you,
forgetting you not for any reason.
O Father in Arutturai Temple,
situated in Vennei Nalloor, south of the Pennai River!
Is it proper for me, formerly your slave,
to claim I am not so anymore?</em>

<b>Appar 6.95 Verse 10</b>
<em>Even if all treasures are bestowed upon us
along with rulership over all the earth and the heavens,
we will not respect the wealth of those
destined to fade away – undevoted to the Lord of the Celestials.
	Yet those whose body decays away,
	home to the vile leprosy disease,
	those pulayars* who wander about
	skinning and eating the flesh of the cow.
	If they are but loving to the Lord
	who hides the Ganga River in his matted locks –
	Behold! It is they who we adore as our God</em>

* “Low-caste” people who are sadly to this day viewed with disdain and are avoided by the “upper-classes”. Appar being a sage of great wisdom doesn’t give a second’s thought to such differences, even if they skin and eat the flesh of the sacred cow. 

<b>Appar 4.81 Verse 4</b>
<em>If one could see the arch of his brow,
and the incomparable smile on His mouth –
red as the kovvai fruit,
the wet cool locks of hair,
and the milky white ash on his coral red body,
if one could see too
the bliss granting foot, golden and raised in dance
then even being born as a human on this wide earth
would be a thing worth wanting</em>

*Some Saiva commentators say that Appar sang this last line sarcastically, as if asking whether anyone would want earthly life, after having been granted vision of Sivan. 

<b>Sambandar 1.10 Verse 2 (a beautiful piece of imagery)</b>
<em>As the branch beats against the black clouds
    being released by the male monkey
    which grabs honied fruits of mango
and as tender raindrops* fall upon the boulder,
the herd of forest cattle seek the shade
in the fields of Annamalai,
    whose Lord wears victorious anklet,
    shaped like the mango leaf,
which annihilates the karma of those who meditate on it</em>

* The recoil of the branch from the monkey releasing it after snatching the mango leads it to beat against the cloud, which causes raindrops to pour.

<b>Sambandar 1.60 Verses 7 – 8*</b>
<em>O ibis birds, in the palmyra nest you join
in tight embrace – separation you know not
you intimate lovers! 
In Thonipuram, where the gentle breeze fills the air, 
He resides, crowned with konrai wreath in matted locks
but I am here,
suffering from his indifference,
You must tell him my plight, ibis birds!

You peck on the flower of mango tree,
with delightful fragrance of milk,
and sing sweet tunes for all to hear
O young and beautiful kuyil.
You must call the King 
who presides over Thonipuram – 
surrounded by fertile fields filled with honey,
and tell him to come to me</em>

* These verses are reminiscent of Manickavasagar’s kuyil patthu or his thirukotthumbee where he employs the kuyil bird and the royal bee respectively as a messenger to reach Siva.

<b>Appar 4.48 Verse 1</b>
<em>Dweller in the heavens, 
The Young One crowned with the crescent moon,
He who is sweet as honey –
Lord of Annamalai,
who wears tusk of the boar,
Rider of the Bull, who destroyed the triple fortresses.
	Could I ever gain salvation,
	if I, his slave, ever forget him?</em>

The famous Namachivaaya pathigam of Sambandar. Namachivaaya is the mystic 5 letters which is considered by Saiva devotees as the single most important mantra.

This was the last pathigam sang by Sambandar. He was coerced into a marriage at the age of 16 by his parents, and as he stood lamenting God’s divine will, a large effulgence appeared. Singing these 10 songs, he took all the guests present at the wedding through the pillar of light into the state of salvation (muththi). 

<b>Sambandar 3.49 Verse 2</b>
<em>When recited by those with steadfast belief,
it gives the sweetness of honey from budding flower. 
Like golden red crown jewel* of the whole world
is the name of our beloved – Namachivaya!</em>

* Sambandar uses the world tilakam referring to the red dot of Kumkum powder applied by women on their foreheads.

<b>Sundarar 7.84 Verse 1</b>
<em>When will I see and worship, to my eye’s delight,
    the One who’s frame is half soft-breasted damsel,
    crowned with young lustrous moon,
    who’s feet are worshipped by devotees?

When will I see and worship, to my eye’s delight,
    the lotus-coloured body,
    and the throat, gleaming dark like rain cloud,
    from the poison of the sea 
which the celestials begged him to eat?

When will I see and worship, to my eye’s delight,
    the eight shoulders,
    as well as the fragrant beauteous locks of hair
    of the Young Man in Kaanapper
    girt by fields full of water?</em>
	
<b>Appar 6.9 Verse 1</b>
<em>He came singing many songs
and took us by force.
Desiring the bangles on our hands, 
His eyes shot arrows at us and he spoke speeches
which stirred up our passion!
O He mounted his swift bull,
wielding skull* in one hand.
He was adorned with gold dust and clad
in animal hide, his form covered in white ash.
He rides away now, come and see Him!
Ayya, The Lord of Amaattur is handsome indeed!</em>

* Appar sings of the beggar form of Siva – Bhiksaatana – and imagines himself as a woman falling in love with the Lord as he comes around asking for alms with skull (beggar bowl) in hand. 

<b>Appar 4.75 Verse 4 (A very important verse)</b>
<em>In the house known as the body,
with the heart as the hollow of the lamp,
daubing worldly experience as ghee,
and fixing life as the wick –
If one were to light the fire of wisdom
and meditate with fixed mind,
            one could see the jewelled feet of the Lord
            Father to the Youth* adorned with Kadamba garland</em>

* Murugan

The first few lines of the following verse address Mangayarkarasi (refer to Sambandar's life history). Sambandar sings this song to assuage her fear that he is outnumbered by the Jains during their debate in Madurai.

<b>Sambandar 3.39 Verse  1</b>
<em>Lady whose eyes are delicate as the deer,
Great Queen, wife of the Pandiya King!
Listen to what I have to say.
Fret not that I am a young boy,
with mouth coated in the smell of milk.
I am not easy to defeat for those
who come from mountains such as Aanaimalai,
the lowly Jains who inflict much sorrow,
      as Aran* of Thiruaalavaai stands by my side</em>  

* Another name for Sivan.

<b>Appar 4.92 Verse 17</b>
<em>Learned wisdom, and the content of that wisdom,
	the resonant Vedas sung by the Vethiyars, and the sacrifices,
	the earth and the heavens,
	the fire, the brilliant red sun and the pure moon,
	the primal cause and the end of everything
		the feet of the Lord in Aiyaaru is all of these</em>

<b>Sundarar 7.48 Verse 7</b>
<em>O you with pure golden locks of hair,
who bent the bow to set fire
to the hostile triple forts,
You whose frame is shared 
by the damsel of fragrant tresses,
Lord of Thiruppandikodumudi, on the shore of Kaveri,
where peacocks dance
to the tunes of cuckoos atop tree branches.
O desirable One, even if I shall forget you
my tongue shall forever utter your name, Namachchivaaya</em>

hen Sundarar approached Kazhumalam (Seerkaazhi), he hesitated to step foot in the city as it was the holy birthplace of Sambandar. Seeing his devotion, Sivan grants him vision, which is what is sung of here:

<b>Sundarar 7.58 Verse 2</b>
<em>I search not for companion even for the next birth.
I suffered, I attained the boon to never forget You.
My family and friends are of no use to me,
I worship You alone, bright flame,
as support in my life. 
You taught me, your servant 
the teachings of wisdom and liberation,
unknown even to the gods of the heavens.
I have beheld Him,
in the fertile city of Kazhumalam</em>

<b>Appar 5.93 Verse 10</b>
<em>He has throat like dark black cloud – 
cause of all things, the Primordial One,
wearing the white crescent moon,
He is as sweet as milk
and is the Young One, united with me.
How can I ever forget him now?</em>

<b>Sundarar 7.24 Verse 5</b>
<em>You are knowledge and all things desired
by lives in the seven worlds.
You are sweet Tamil, infused with melody
and the supreme light beyond all things.
O ruby of Mazhapaadi,
surrounded by flowery groves.
Who else but you, my leader, can I even think of now</em>

Finally, the last pathigam sung by Sundarar, singing about the white elephant that Sivan sent to take him to Kailai Mountain. 

<b>Sundarar 7.100 Verse 1</b> 
<em>He gave me a form on this earth,
and knowing that I sang songs on his golden feet. 
Alas! He gave even me, low as the dog,
a place within his group of devotees.
To the welcome of the celestials
He graced me with the frenzied elephant.
O He is the Lord of Nodithaan Mountain
who elevated my body and life!</em>
