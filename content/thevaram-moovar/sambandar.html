Thirugnanasambandar or just Gnanasambandar or Sambandar (Thiru – holy, gnanam – wisdom) is arguably the most important of the religious poets of South India. He is grouped as chief of the moovar (group of three), along with Appar and Sundarar as the exalted poets of Saiva worship. 

There is a proverb in Tamil: பிள்ளை பாதி புராணம் பாதி (Half for the child, half for Puranam). This is in reference to the Periya Puranam a hagiography of 63 revered devotees of Lord Siva. The full text consists of 4286 songs, of which almost 1300 are dedicated to the life history of Sambandar alone. 

He is credited with almost singlehandedly re-establishing Saiva worship, after the dominance of Jainism and Buddhism in India. 

He was a child prodigy born in the town of Seekazhi in the 7th century and started composing poems called tevarams at the age of 3. 

One day he went to the temple with his father, who was going to bathe in the temple tank and do his morning rituals. As his father entered the tank, Sambanthar was gripped by fear, and cried "Amme! Appa!" ("Mother! Father!")

At that moment Sivan appeared on his Bull mount with his consort, Parvati. He instructs Parvati to feed Sambandar with breast milk of gnosis. She appears before the crying child, wiping his tears and handing him the golden cup with a tender smile on her face.

Sambandar acheived enlightment the moment he drank the milk, and was immersed in a sea of bliss. His father came back at that moment to see his son with milk drops on his face.

Upset that someone else had given his child milk, he asks angrily "Who fed you milk?" to which Sambandar composed his first song "Thodudaiya seviyan". Singing and dancing he points to the sky where Sivan granted him vision. The image on the left shows this pose!

Following this, Sambandar spent his life worshipping at various shrines of Siva all over India, spending his time with towns folk and injecting their communities with positivity and Saivism. 

His most celebrated story is the debate at Madurai. Mangayarkarasi, the wife of the queen of Madurai was a devout Saiva, yet her husband (Koon Pandian – Koon means hunchback) had been swayed by Jains into following their religion and had thus caused Saivism in Madurai do diminish mightily. 

Therefore, Mangayarkarasi requests Sambandar to come to Madurai. Although Appar warns him, saying that the planetary alignment is an evil omen and that he should wait an extra day before leaving, Sambandar sings the famous kOLaRu pathigam, asserting that a devotee of Siva need not worry about astrology. 

Sambandar reaches Madurai and the Jains, sensing that it is a danger to their status, try and harm him by trying to burn down the place he was staying in. 

However, everything they tried failed miserably, and instead the flames had manifested inside Koon Pandian as an incurable disease. 

Mangayarkarasi convinces her husband to let Sambandar cure the disease, while the Jains were insisting that they could. Eventually it was agreed that Sambandar would try and cure the right half of Koon Pandian’s body, while the Jains would try and cure the left. 

The Jains went first and after their mantras had failed, Sambandar takes holy ash and sings the thirunERu pathigam, glorifying the power of the holy ash. Upon rubbing it on the king’s body the right side was entirely cured, but the force of the disease on the right side had now spread entirely onto the left side which the Jains were responsible for!

Sambandar ends up curing the King entirely, but the Jains, still unable to accept defeat demand further contests. Trial by fire ensues, and although the Jains’ scriptures burn when placed in fire, the Saiva scriptures remain unharmed. 

Still unable to accept defeat, the Jains convince the king to give them one more contest. Both parties are to place their scriptures in the river, and which ever remains where it is and isn’t carried away by the water current is the true religion. 

The Jains place their palm leaves in the water, but to their horror it is carried away, while Sambandar places his palm leaf, which swims in the opposite direction to the water current. 

Unable to prolong the contests anymore the Jains accept defeat. The rest of the story has little to no historical evidence, as the Jains are forced to accept Saivism or be impaled. This may very well be a later insertion to assert the resurgence of Saivism.  

In total, Sambandar lived for 16 years after which, during his wedding, him and all the guests present were said to have attained liberation after merging into a large pillar of light. 

His poetry is a celebration of the vitality and optimism afforded by Lord Siva. He is praised by many, including Arunagiri and Vallalar, as the incarnation of Lord Murukan himself. 

Arunagiri in particular sang Sambandar’s praises plentifully, and in the Thiruezhukootritukai he hails him as முத்தமிழ் விரகன் நாற்கவி ராஜன் (Master of the 3 Tamil literatures, King of the 4 Tamil poetries). The branches of Tamil literature are iyal, isai, nadakam (text, music, drama). This is particularly noteworthy as Sambandar, more so than his contemporaries, handled many different pann (musical scales) in the singing of his poems. More pertinent for our discussion is his superiority in the 4 branches of Tamil poetry. These are:

Aasu kavi – Improvisational poetry based on a prompt given by someone else

Mathura kavi – Ornamentational poetry, which is sweet in meaning-content and in sound

Chitra kavi – Poetry where the words contain a complicated pattern, or form a picture

Vitthara kavi – Lengthy poetry on a single theme
