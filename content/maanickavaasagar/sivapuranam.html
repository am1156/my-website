The very first composition which is listed out of the 51 in the Thiruvasagam is the Sivapuranam (Legend of Siva) which is written in a form of the difficult venpa metre. 

The poem details Siva with such transparently beautiful abstractness. It is a treasure trove of Saiva Siddhanta philosophy and is of use for simple worship as well as an extreme in-depth analysis. Siva is praised as the indwelling force which drives one to salvation, the one more tender than a mother’s love even to those lowlier than a dog, and the great flood of compassion, precious as ambrosia. 

This maturity and depth of thought suggests that it is unlikely to be the first to be composed in a chronological ordering of the Thiruvasagam, in contrast it is an <b>ecstatic outpouring of the total sum of Manickavasagar’s love for Siva.</b>

<b>Sivapuranam Lines 31 - 48:</b>
<em>Having taken a multitude of births, I have grown weary my Lord
Yet having truly beheld your golden Feet, 
I have today gained liberation
O Primordial sound which frees me, resonant in my soul
True One, He who is beyond the malas*, Master of the bull 
Unattainable to the Vedas who cry “Ayya!”
as you rise as the Minute nuance, who deepens and broadens 

You are the heat and the cold, You are Vimala, 
You stand as the body’s soul
You came in grace caused all that is false to flee
You are True knowledge, glistening like a bright flame
O blissful Lord, to me who possess no wisdom You
Wipe my ignorance away, O wise One

You who have no beginning, no measure, no end!
Who creates, protects and destroys all worlds, and shower Your grace,
O You who liberates and joins me amidst Your band of devotees
O subtlety of fragrance, He is who far, yet who nears us
You are the meaning of the Vedas, 
Standing where speech and thought disappear

Like the mixture of milk and sugar cane and butter
Soaked in sweet honey You delight the thoughts of sincere devotees
Lord to us all! who severs the continuity of birth</em>
