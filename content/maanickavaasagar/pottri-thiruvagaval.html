The fourth composition is the Potri Thiruagaval, the longest poem of the Thiruvasagam by far, totalling 225 lines. 

It starts with a long description of the dangers faced by a soul, from as early as conception in the womb to the sorrows of worldly life. This is followed by the hardships it faces even after it desires to grasp God, as forces such as atheism and misguided faith attack the seeking soul. 

Navigating even these, the soul finds a glimmer of light and grips firm on to it, and this guides the soul slowly and steadily into ecstatic apprehension of Sivan. The remaining ~130 lines are salutations to the Lord, including the famous:

<b>Potri Thiruagaval Lines 164 – 165:</b>
<em>thennaa dudaiya sivanE pOTRi
ennaat tavarkkum iRaivaa pOTRI

Glory to Sivan of the Southern country!
Glory to He whos is the Lord of every country!</em>

Manickavasagar also introduces a novelty in these first four compositions of the Thiruvasagam. 

As equals to the Sanskrit “mantra endings” such as namaha and swaha, Manickavasagar creates 4 such mantra endings in Tamil. These begin in the Sivapuranam with the lines which end with vazhga (literally: long live), velga (victory to) and pottri (hail). These mantra-like lines are continued in the Thiruvandapaguthi, where he also introduces the fourth mantra ending kaanka (behold!):

The lines in the Pottri Thiruvagaavl follow on like this, stacking praises one after another in exceeding passion. One of Manickavasagar’s main goals in singing the praise of the Lord in this way is to firmly establish the ability to recite mantras in his and our mother tongue – Tamil. 

For example a passage from the Thiruvandappaguthi which is full of mantras:

<b>Thiruvandapaguthi Lines 29 – 35 and 58 – 64:</b>
<em>Behold the most ancient one, behold Him the complete
Behold Him who is beyond compare
Behold Him who is adorned with ancient tusk of the boar
Behold Him who wears hide of the forest tiger around His waist
Behold Him smeared with ash, as I think on Him
Behold! I can’t stand it * – I will perish
Behold He who is, like sweet music of the Veena
…
Behold! I saw Him with my own eyes
Behold the ambrosia which yields abundant grace
Behold! I saw the greatness of His compassion
Behold! He impressed His feet upon the earth
Behold! I was assured He was Sivan
Behold! He made me His own and graced me
Behold He who shares His form, with her of waterlily-like eyes</em>

Note: can’t stand the separation from the Lord is the implication

A unque feature of the Pottri Thiruvagaval though is the section which details the holy march towards salvation. This part is long and beautiful, we look at just the ending to this passage:

<b>Potri Thiruagaval Lines 80 – 86:</b>
<em>As softening bones melt,
with a heart that yearns with each breath –
overflowing the banks of the river called love,
they cry “Our Leader”, as the senses converged on Him. 
With rambling speech, as hairs stood erect,
as their hands, verily flowers, folded in worship like lotus bud,
as their hearts blossomed,
they thus stood with teary eyes, gleaming of delight – 
with love undiminishing, day by day –
Hail Mother like One to those devotees </em>
