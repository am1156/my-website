A collection of compositions from the Thiruvasagam are written from the point of view of young girls, usually as an accompaniment to the games and activities they take part in. 

For example, the Thiruponsunnam, was written by our sage when he observed the rhythmic pounding of gold by a group of girls, to be mixed with perfumes and used for sprinkling. Thus, the ending of each of the 20 verses is some variation of பொற்சுண்ணம் இடித்தும், நாமே! (we crush the sacred gold dust!).

Another interesting poem is the Thirusazhal. Sazhal is a game wherein girls split into two groups and involve one side playfully interrogating the other with a series of questions about the other’s beliefs, which all need to be answered. This poem is structured such that the first half of each verse involves the question – in this case an objection about Siva’s actions or iconography - from one side and the second half involves the corresponding response. 

However, the most revered of these poems is the Thiruvempavai. It is a set of 20 verses, and the poem is written from the perspective of a group of unmarried girls observing the paavai nonbu, in which they renounce all sensual pleasures and perform religious austerities during the month of December. 

These involve awaking at or before sunrise, taking a bath and offering prayers at the temple. The poem follows these women as they first go around to the neighbouring houses and attempt to wake their lazier friends up, then travel altogether to a beautiful pond filled with flowers and take their morning bath:

<b>Thiruvempaavai Song 1:</b>
<em>We sing the praises of that great pillar of light that knows 
No beginning nor end; hearing us, O long eyed maiden
How can you still sleep? You must simply be deaf!
The song of the great King’s jewelled feet 
Has travelled through the street
To this girl, who so affected now, sobs uncontrollably
She has forgotten the world! On her flowery bed she tosses and turns –
You note nothing and lie here indifferently. Enne! Enne!
Can this be our friend’s true nature? Rise fair maiden!</em>

<b>Thiruvempaavai Song 17:</b>
<em>Neither the red eyed Vishnu, nor Brahma
Or the celestials have tasted a joy like ours!
O you with fragrant black locks of hair, He came,
To rule us and rise in grace throughout our homes.
He is the Warrior who blessed us His Golden Feet, 
O beautiful eyed one, 
Ever-sweet nectar to your slaves – our Great One!
Let us sing His praises as delight abounds,
As we plunge and dance in this pond of lotus flowers</em>

The next poem is the Thiruammanai, which was sung by Manickavasagar to accompany a game played by girls in a circle, tossing a small ball to one another at a great pace. 

This consists of 20 poems as well. The 17th song is an interesting verse which captures the beauty and simplicity of nayaka-nayaki bhavam (conception of God as one’s lover) as envisioned by Manickavasagar. 

Note also the technique of all lines starting similarly (sUduvEn, kUduvEn, UduvEn, thEduvEn etc.). This is a beautiful characteristic of Tamil poetry, which I have tried to replicate here.

<b>Thiruvammaanai Song 17:</b>
<em>I’ll wear the flowery konrai wreath, and with Sivan’s mighty shoulders
I’ll join and embrace and overcome by that state,
I’ll sulk and pine with love for his red lips, and thus melting
I’ll seek him, and meditate on Sivan’s jewelled feet,
I’ll wilt and once again blossom. Wielding fire
He dances. SEE! Sing the praises of Him Ammanai!</em>

Although quite difficult to restrict myself to only a verses out of the many beautiful ones which fall into this category, I present here a few each from a different composition:

<b>Thellenam Song 9:</b>
<em>He shed my stony exterior to reveal sweet fruit –  
That tender-hearted One,
Who ruled over me and gave me His golden Foot. 
Sing his Praises!
O you with waists slender as lightning, 
Red coral lips and white smile
Call for the Lord of the South and beat Tellenam!</em>

<b>Thiruppoovalli Song 1:</b>
<em>The moment he gently placed his Feet on my head,
My surroundings, my relatives – I wholly renounced it all! 
In Thillai, encircled by vast dams filled with water, He dances.
O Sing the glory of He who is like Raft* and pluck the lily flowers! </em>

* This reference to God as a raft, providing support for devotees being violently tossed by the waves of this ocean like world, was also encountered in the Kantar Alangaram and the Thiruchatagam. 

<b>Tholnokkam Song 5:</b>
<em>As earth, water and as fire, as the vast sky, 
As the moon and the sun,
As intelligence, He in eightfold ways joins 
In mystic embrace with mere man
As the 7 worlds and the 10 directions He moves, 
Yet he is the Singular One.
Who manifests as the many, 
Praising Him we play Tolnokkam!</em>

A very interesting decad which defies translation is the Annai patthu in which the girl speaks with her mother with a childlike excitement of her vision of Siva. The 2nd and 3rd line feature repetition and there is a refrain of அன்னே என்னும்.

<b>Annaip paththu Songs 2 and 4:</b>
<em>His eyes gleam of dye, He is a compassionate sea
He dwells within me and melts me Mother!
He dwells within and melts me causing a stream
Of ceaseless blissful tears, O Mother what is this!

Adorned with dancing snake, tiger skin and sacred ash
This is the form he wears O Mother!
Beholding the form he wears – my mind
Wilts with desire! O Mother, what is this?</em>

<b>Kuyil Paththu 3:</b>
<em>O Kuyil of dark blue hue! In virtuous Uttharakosa mangai’s shrine,
Whose tall walls rise with rich gems, He resides – radiating of beauty, 
He is one with the Lady with form like creeper, and the cause 
Of brightness in this world. Go O Kuyil, and call Him to me!</em>

The above verse comes from a collection called the kuyil (koel bird) patthu, where in each song the refrain consists of varied descriptions of the kuyil’s appearance or its song, as well as telling it to call Siva here. Mystically the kuyil is representative of the soul. 

The following are excerpts from a poem called Thirupalliezhucchi, which literally translates to arising from divine sleep. The Lord is paraded through the temple while laying on a couch at daybreak, and every verse calls for him to arise to bless the crowded devotees.

<b>Thiruvempaavai Songs 3 and 4:</b>
<em>The Kuyil sounds its tender note, and the cocks crow with vigour,
The little birds cry with delight, the conchs resonate
The lustre of the stars dims as daylight rises upon the eastern hill,
	In the resplendence of morning, to us in love,
Grant us your Feet, bright and ornamented with jewels
	O great Siva, who resides in Thiruperunthurai,
He who is hard to attain, yet easy to those who are Thine own,
	O our Lord, arise from Your divine sleep to bless us!

There stand the players of lilting tunes on the veenai and the yazh
	And those that chant the Vedic praises
There stand those with garlands of flowers intertwined
	And those who in delight, weep and cry and faint
There stand those in prayer with clasped hands on heads
	O great Siva, who resides in Thiruperunthurai
O Lord who makes even me Thine Own and adorns me 
With sweet grace, arise from Your divine sleep to bless us!</em>
