The Neethal Vinnapam is a heart-rending set of 50 poems in the beautiful kattalaik kalithurai metre. The title roughly translates to “Prayer to not be abandoned” and is one of the most genuine and raw cries for divine help that Manickavasagar has composed. 

It paints our sage as increasingly vulnerable and desperate, at one point torn between the fear of losing his devotion and the attraction of the 5 forms of sensuality, a sentiment he touchingly captures in the phrase ஈர்க்கின்ற அஞ்சொடச்சம் வினையேனை இருதலையே. 

The perpetual refrain of each 4-line verse includes விட்டிடுதி கண்டாய் (Will you abandon me?) in the 2nd line and in the first 20 verses also has உத்தரகோசமங்கைக்கரசே (King of Uttharakosamangai). 

The whole set is linked together under the Antati arrangement, where a subsequent verse starts with syllabic units, a word or even a phrase which was used at the very end of the previous verse. The effect is quite remarkable in Tamil. 


<b>Song 14:</b>
<em>Amidst a FLOOD, I stood thirsty, 
Even after gaining Your grace. From sorrow
I refused to part, Will You abandon me? In the minds of 
loving servants you reside, O King of Uttharakosamangai,
to I, the mean one, grant me a BLISS I have never before experienced</em>

See how beautifully he describes the form of Sivan, adorned with snake, moon and garland of skull, as the Gangai River leaps in his matted locks of hair:

<b>Song 42:</b>
<em>O Goal of Bliss, to this slave You graced Your feet,
slave I am, fated not to shed this flesh – forsake me not!
O King with matted locks of hair,
where the moon plunges and hides in the deep water
fearing the bright snake which spreads its hood
from the cave of the white skull</em>


<b>Song 49:</b>
<em>I’ll make them laugh, and I’ll bear the burden of life, 
Devoting my services to only You, Siva,
Can this stop You from abandoning me? 
If not I shall abuse You fully! – 
O Madman who adorns Himself
With hide of the elephant and the tiger, 
Madman who drinks poison, 
Madman who resides in burning cemetery, 
Madman who chose even Me to make Thine Own!</em>

The first line is sung out of derision. Out of desperation, Manickavasagar makes the threat that he will make others mock the Lord. 

This is a striking verse. The greatness of the Lord is expounded through a series of statements which at first seem to be insults (ninda stuti). Siva drinking poison in particular is a popular story in the Saiva cannon. 

When the devas attempted to extract ambrosia from the ocean by churning it with a snake, the snake reaches a point of exhaustion and gags poison into the mixture. Clamouring out of fear the devas pray to Siva, who accepts their cries for help and drinks the poison so as to give the others nectar. 

Similarly, he is commonly pictured as dancing with his group of demons in the cemetery which stands as a symbol of Sivan’s compassion to provide liberation to souls after the end of life. 

The last “insult” is most beautiful. Manickavasagar wonders at the compassion of Siva, to choose someone as worthless as himself to shape into a true devotee. More than ever my words fail to express the true emotion of this verse.
