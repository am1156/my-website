The third of the compositions in the Thiruvasagam is the Thiruvandapaguthi of 182 lines. It is a beautiful composition which details the nature of Sivan, both in his form and formless nature. This is interspersed with both autobiographical sections as well as a long famous allegory of 30 lines which builds a magnificent and vivid description of nature which culminates in the metaphor of Sivan as a rain cloud.

The poem starts as follows:

<b>Thiruvandapaguthi Lines 1 - 6:</b>
<em>The matter Universe, spherical, brilliant, radiant
Of immeasurable nature; and rich, ever-growing form.
Praise the beauty of those heavenly bodies intertwined
In number much greater than a billion!
Yet miniscule compared to the Great One, mere atoms of dust
Suspended in the sunlight which creeps in through the window*</em>

* The beauty of this passage in the Tamil original is that two interpretations are possible. One: Sivan is all-encompassing to the point that whole universes look like atoms of dust. The second interpretation is that Sivan is the most minute nuance, so small that the minute atoms of dust look like whole universes compared to him!

The famous cloud allegory which was aforementioned is given below:

<b>Thiruvandapaguthi Lines 65 - 95:</b>
<em>It is the ancient sea of supreme happiness
Appearing like a vast black cloud
And rising above holy Perunthurai
As beautiful lightning flashes across all directions
Destroying the snake of the 5 sensual bondages

While the sadness of relentless heat subsides,
While the beautiful Thonri flower radiates brightly,
And insects swarm like our multitude of births
The superlative compassion of God resonates, 
Like echo of murasu drum
And supplicating hands stretch
like the blossom of Kanthal flower

Bliss, never-ending, fall as tender raindrops
As the glistening flood swells on every side, rising
Like a mountain – destroying the pond of sadness
And yet the six-sects attract, like mirage
Seen by the thirsty herd of long eyed deer

Who crowd, with desire to drink
And stagger, helpless, with unquenched thirst. 
At that moment, the heavenly stream 
Jumps and rises, whirls with delight
Rushes and crashes against the shores of our worldly bondage

And still grows, snatching by its roots the great tree 
Of our previous deeds, accumulated birth by birth.
That beautiful flood of grace flows through unscalable hills,
Yet is trapped by the dam of Santam tree
Where grows flower of the devotee’s heart, 
fragrant, and sweet as honey

In that dam where the smoke of the agil rises, and bees hum
Beholding that wondrous sight – 
The ever-increasing flood of grace,
In those fertile fields of worship,
The farmers plant seeds of love for Him
Hail! Cloud like God, hard to attain </em>

Many metaphors are present in this section. The sea is supreme happiness of God realization. The cloud is God in the form of Guru, and it reaches the mountain which is Thiruperunthurai (recall Manickavaasagar’s life history). 

The snake are the venomous 5 senses which bind man to earthly life. The heat of the summer is the suffering which results. The blossoming of the thondri flower is the appearance of God in the form of a Guru. The swarming insects are the innumerable births a soul must take. The thundering echo of the murasu drum is God’s righteous wrath at our cycle of birth and death. The graceful words and actions of God are the tender raindrops. These fill in the dam which represents the Temple. The fields represent worship, where farmers who are the devotees experience bliss.
