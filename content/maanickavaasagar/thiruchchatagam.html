The so-called “4 agavals” of the Thiruvasagam contain  Manickavasagar’s explanation of Sivan’s ancestry and traits (Sivapuranam, Thiruvandapaguthi), his acts of grace (Keerthi Thiruvagaval), the ways of the world and an ecstatic outpouring of devotion (Pottri Thiruvagaval). 

This section constitutes a sort of preface to the remaining 47 compositions in the Thiruvasagam. We can probably put these to be composed at the end of Manickavasagar’s human life, before he merged in the effulgence of Sivan once and for all. 

This leaves the 5th part, namely the Thiruchchatagam to be the first indication of Manickavasagar the human. We must not forget that he too was born merely human, a human who acquired through incredible thavam a deep and all-encompassing love for God. 

His spiritual journey is a story of merciless self-abasement which purged his soul into one capable of a deep emotional connection with God. This self-abasement first rears its head in the beautiful magnum opus that is the Thiruchchatagam.

Thiru means holy and chatagam means hundred. The 100 songs in the composition is made of 10 groups of 10 (pathigam). Each pathigam is of a different poetic grammar and metre (yaappu). Manickavasagar was probably the first to conceive of such a beautiful construction. 

Furthermore the entire set of songs is linked by the anthaathi construction where the ending of each song becomes in some way the starting of the next song. For example the first song ends with kaNdukoLLE  and the second song starts with koLLEn.


<b>Verse 1</b>:
<em>As my frame blossoms open
as I tremble before Your fragrant Feet;
Placing my hands on my head as my eyes
overflow with tears and my soul melts,
rejecting all that is false, I cry ‘Pottri! Jaya jaya Pottri!’
while not for a moment allowing my devotion
to slip, O Lord, SEE me!</em>

Manickavasagar thus starts with a vivid picture of his devotion. His single-minded nature is reinforced beyond doubt:

<b>Verse 2</b>:
<em>I will not consider the lives of Indiran, Vishnu or Brahma
as a thing worth having,
I will mingle, even if my life is ruined,
with none but Your devotees 
I will not scold You, even if by Your grace
I am sent to Hell
I will not, O Lord, think of another
besides You, our Perfect One</em>

Yet Manickavasagar at this stage of his journey is in a constant battle with his mind. He is constantly ravaged by his imperfections and inner selfishness, leading him to sing:

<b>Verse 6</b>:
<em>Thavam I have not performed,
neither have I strewn you constantly with cool flowers –
born in vain with wicked karma
I have not gained the bliss of your devotee’s company,
O Transcendental One!
Grant me a birth tied to your Divine Feet </em>

A heart-rending petition. Foregoing even the unparalleled desire to snap the chain of birth and death, Manickavasagar pleads for even another birth if that would give him the chance to perform service to the Lord. 

This is the true essence of the Thiruvasagam. The common thread throughout all 658 songs, in fact the only petition Manickasavasgar makes to Sivan is admission into the company of the holy devotees. What it means to be amidst the devotees, and perform service is later explained by Manickavasagar:

<b>Verse 14</b>:
<em>To become pure for your Holy Feet,
    my heart does not melt, nor do I melt in love,
    I do not string flowery garlands nor do I praise You
O Lord of the Celestials
    I do not clean your temple, nor do I dance in joy
Through worldly mire I am hurrying towards death</em>

Manickavasagar next turns to his heart, languishing at his inability to hold on to the Lord with conviction. 

The contrast in the words vaazhkinRaai vaazhaatha nenjE (you live, unliving heart) is how our sage draws a line between mere worldly pursuits and his spiritual goal. This line becomes the fulcrum of the Thiruchatagam, as Manickavasagar helplessly seesaws between both sides of this boundary.

<b>Verse 20</b>:
<em>O unliving soul – you live here in false joy; mired in evil deeds
you drown – praising not he who protects the sinking
I tell you often – you are devising your own ruin, 
yet you fall, into that flood of sadness</em>

Throughout the Thiruvasagam we see a constant reminder of how unfit Manickavasgar proclaims himself to be, to receive the grace of the Lord. Few verses capture this feeling more beautifully than the following one:

<b>Verse 21</b>:
<em>The moment they hear the words
    Rider of the Bull! Lord of the Celestials
    He with matted locks of hair which contain the Ganges
they tremble and melt with desire
forceful as a flood rushing downhill,
yet leaving them, as they stand waiting,
O Superior One, You chose to rule me –
who, head to toe, is like the heart does not melt
my whole body, is like eyes which don’t shed a flood of tears
my soul is verily hard as rock,
and the eyes of me, bound by evil karma, is rugged wood </em>
			
Manickavasagar expounds the qualities of a true devotee, who melts and cries even in the moment that they hear the name of the Lord. Yet he also wonders in amazement at the grace of the Lord who graced him regardless. 

And how exactly was he graced? The following verse gives a glimpse into the answer:

<b>Verse 26</b>:
<em>Mere dog I am, yet you made my thought fixate on You alone,
made my eyes see nothing else but your divine Foot
and made me bow down before no-one else but You, 
my speech You made to only sing your praises, precious as diamond. 
My five senses You conquered and made me Thine own.

O Great Sea of nectar! He who is like Mountain!
You gave yourself, red as forest of lotus flowers,
To lonely me, without wisdom or knowledge, 
O singular Radiance!</em>

However again Manickavasagar swings back to his inadequacies in the very next song where he uses a very fitting piece of imagery to describe the sea of births and rebirths which the aspiring devotee has to cross:

<b>Verse 27</b>:
<em>Tossed by the raging waves of the sea of births,
with no support to cling to –
as the tempest of desire for women with ruddy coral lips
swirled all around me,
thinking  “What is there to redeem me now”
as I was caught by the jaws of the shark which is lust –
    it was then I caught hold of the raft
    of the mystic five letters,

O Holy One!
To me the lonely one, the worthless one,
You ruled over me in grace
showing me the fertile shore without beginning or end</em>

Yet Manickavasagar’s pain due to his separation from the Lord only increases and increases, even to the point where he sings the following, despairing at the fact that he is still clinging on to his body in this worldly life:

<b>Verse 39</b>:
<em>Everlasting and incomparable are His bright flowery feet
which he granted to me, of a kind lower than dog.
He is my Leader, who showed me the way to salvation
with a sweet love greater than even a mother’s,
I see Him not, yet I don’t jump into the fire
nor do I roll down the rocky mountain
will I possibly plunge into the ocean</em>

Manickavasagar continues in this way for a bit, but in the 57th verse gives a very important hint. When Sivan came in the form of a Guru and graced him, Manickavasagar was left behind on the earth while all the other devotees present there entered the pillar of light which emerged and joined with God. 

The song relates this event as well as suggests that perhaps it was a split second attachment to his wife (as suggested in the last two lines) which made him stay back on that fateful day.

<b>Verse 57</b>:
<em>You decided 
To abandon me, while your true slaves
You embraced. 
    It is just! I, in boundless sadness, saw a girl’s lips
Quiver
    And on her forehead a bead of sweat, as her dress
Flutters
    Such is the ruin I search out for myself</em>

In the next group of ten, Manickavasagar bursts out in rapturous praise of the Lord as he catches a faint glimmer of hope amidst a sea of despair:

<b>Verse 70</b>:
<em>Hail to You who is the earth, water, fire, wind and the skies
Hail to You, birthless yet originator of all lives
Hail to You, endless, yet the endpoint of all lives
Hail to You, the omnipresent One beyond the reach of the five senses</em>

The 8th group of 10 songs is a beautiful blend of Manickasavasgar’s visceral cries for grace with a poetic metre which is a joy to experience in the original Tamil. 

<b>Verse 74</b>:
<em>Removing all that is false
I want true love unto your jewelled Feet,
O King, take pity on me
and truly bless me who is low as the cur.
Adorning myself with true devotion,
I will cry “Hail to You, Hail”
even as I die and die and come again*
to worship You. </em>

*come again – be reborn on this earth

Thus Manickavasagar throws away the shackle of desiring salvation in this birth, and similar to the 2nd and 5th verse, although in a more direct manner, exclaims emphatically his love for the Lord. 

In the next group of 10, we can see our sage’s mindset change once more. He is crushed by the recollection of Sivan leaving him on this earth while all the other devotees gained salvation. 

<b>Verse 85</b>:
<em>Partner of Her with eyes like the deer,
He who is unknowable to the boundaries of the Vedas,
sweet as honey and ambrosia, yet unknown to thought,
King who bears the lowly deeds of this wretch!
I lament telling my woes.
Your devotees have reached the great city,
outside, I wander here with my falseness</em>

In another song of this section, the metaphor he uses to describe this episode is simply heart-rending.

<b>Verse 87</b>:
<em>My Master, to me your slave, give me love unto your Feet.
Your devotees have reached the land of no return
yet outside I remain – like the blind cow
which lows with the village cows*
I am estranged from your Feet,
bewildered I weep!</em>

* As the village cows return from grazing and see their stables close by they call out for their calves. The blind cow which travels with them cannot see the stable nor its calves, but it calls out too. 

The final group of 10 verses are again in a beautiful sprightly meter which captures the jubilation and effervescent joy of Manickavasagar’s God Realisation which he experiences. 

One really should write a whole page on just these 10 poems. Instead, here we will just touch on some key points:

•	Manickavasagar compares himself to a child who holds a golden bowl in its hand, unaware of the value and rarity of gold and treating it like a regular bowl. It’s difficult to express our inability to grasp the greatness of Sivan more succinctly than this

•	Another metaphor is people don’t cut down a tree they grew, even if it happens to be poisoned. Manickavasagar compares his relationship with God to this

We will conclude with the final song which underscores the final note of jubilation which the whole set of 100 songs was building up to. 

<b>Verse 100</b>:
<em>I long to sing Your praise, Pottri!
	As my soul melts and my mind sinks in love
I long to dance, Pottri! In the divine court
	Where You dance, before Your flowery Foot, I a mere dog
Long to join, Pottri! So that this body –
	House of filth may cease, Pottri! From all that is false
I long to leave, Pottri! That final liberation
	You must grace, Pottri! O to true devotees you are TRUTH</em>

The poem starts "mey thaan arumbi" and finishes with the word "meyyanE" completing the anthaathi arrangement.
