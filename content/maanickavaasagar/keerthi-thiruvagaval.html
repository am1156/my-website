Sent by the king to go buy horses, Manickavasagar travelled through Thiruperunthurai when Sivan came bearing the form of a sage, encircled by one hundred devotees. He sat under the kurunthai tree, and as Manickavasagar saw him he was drawn by a deep and swelling love. Manickavasagar recounts the various acts of grace which occurred there, for example:

<b>Thiruppoovalli Song 1 Lines 1 - 2</b>
<em>The moment He placed his twin Feet on my head,
My companions, my relatives – I wholly renounced it all!</em>

However, Sivan takes the opportunity to enact a divine drama. Conjuring an effulgence of light, He guides all 100 devotees into it towards salvation, in front of Manickavasagar’s eyes. After they all pass and Manickavasagar alone is left, Sivan eyes him and says “Come to Thillai”, before stepping foot in the pillar of light and disappearing. The resulting pain of separation from the Lord and the feeling of being the only one left behind is the heartbeat of the whole Thriuvasagam. This scene is revisited in countless places throughout the Thiruvasagam, with few as touching and descriptive as the Keerthi Thiruagaval:

<b>Keerthi Thiruagaval Lines 127 – 146</b>
<em>Mere cur I am, He bade me come to glorious Thillai
where shines the beauteous stage,
yet He left me here, befitting indeed!

That day those servants who were graced to go with Him
merged with Him one by one in perfect union
yet those who gained Him not leaped in the fire!

Bewilderment overcame others –
on the earth they fell and rolled and cried,
as others still, with hurry in their step,
rushed to enter the sea as they wailed
“Our Lord Our Lord” –
as such were those that gained His Foot,
while others hailed Him saying
“O Divine Dancer who graced Patanjali”
and reviling the world, continued to yearn.

He dances in the goldcapped halls of Puliyur,
    beautiful as the Himalayas themselves –
and with sight of beauteous smile on his Holy face,
    like that which he graces unto red-lipped Uma and Kali, 
the King surrounded by saints, joyously entered Puliyur –
High Lord of Kailai that resounds with rapturous song!</em>
