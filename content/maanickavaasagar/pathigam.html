The majority of compositions in the Thiruvasagam are in the pathigam style, which is a group of approximately 10 songs in the same metre and same theme. 

This length is typically considered the gold standard of religious poetic expression. This is the final “chapter” of the Thiruvasagam, where Manickavasagar makes his final spiritual push to reach Siva. 

Therefore, I have also chosen a “pathigam” of verses, however the metre and the theme will vary to try and paint a complete picture of this section:

<b>Koyil Mooththa Thiruppathigam 7</b>
<em>I wander here, cheated, believing that the dancer in the Divine Court
	Might condescend and show pity even to me
Ruler! He who teaches the rarest of teachings
	Am I to become like a cow with no leader?
You with your saints, who in joyful union
	Draw near and surround you. Might you
O One who infuses me life,
	Bid me to come, so that I may attain you?</em>

<b>Aasaip paththu 6</b>
<em>I grow weary, mere dog I am – take back this worldly life
Which you gave. O You whose rose like Feet 
Are unattainable to the devas
And who is beyond bondage, O You with gleaming face and 
Tender joyful smile which, O Father, I dearly pine to see</em>

<b>Punarchchip paththu 7</b>
<em>Unknown to the thought of others, You stand as
Fire, water, wind, earth and the vast skies,
The Singular One, beyond compare.
O when will I behold Him, as my throat chokes
And musters not even feeble sound, as tears from my eyes,
Like waterfall flow, as my hands fold in worship,
When will I strew Him with fragrant flowers,
And with my Pure Gem, stand in mystic embrace?</em>

<b>Vaazhap paththu 1</b>
<em>Transcendent One extending through the heavens and the earth,
My Lord, See! I have no support but you.
You shine with greatness, King of Civapuram,
O Sivan enshrined in Thiruperunthurai.
To who shall I complain, who can I blame, 
If you who rule over me grace me not?
See! I live not in this sea-girt world,
Grace me, by bidding me near you!</em>

<b>Kanda paththu 6</b>
<em>He severed the worldly bondages, cause of ill-discipline, and
Made me a mad man amongst men! He tied me forever, with
Strong rope of willing mind, to His divine Foot, O Wise One!
Who sports playfully in ever radiant Tillai I HAVE SEEN!</em>

The following verse is from one of the Sage’s most beautiful compositions. GU Pope writes “It would be hard to find a more touching expression of absolute mystic self-renunciation than these verses contain”. 

I urge the reader to contemplate these verses in the original Tamil. 

<b>Kuzhaiththa Paththu 7 and 8:</b>
அன்றே என்றன் ஆவியும் உடலும் 
  உடைமை எல்லாமுங்
குன்றே அனையாய் என்னைஆட் கொண்ட
  போதே கொண்டிலையோ
இன்றோர் இடையூ றெனக்குண்டோ எண்தோள் 
  முக்கண் எம்மானே
நன்றே செய்வாய் பிழை செய்வாய் நானோ 
  இதற்கு நாயகமே  

நாயிற் கடையாம் நாயேனை நயந்து
  நீயே ஆட்கொண்டாய்
மாயப் பிறவி உன்வசமே 
  வைத்திட்டிருக்கும் அதுவன்றி
ஆயக்கடவேன் நானோதான் 
  என்ன தோஇங் கதிகாரங்
காயத் திடுவாய் உன்னுடைய 
  கழற்கீழ் வைப்பாய் கண்ணுதலே

<b>Translation (GU Pope):</b>
<em>That very day my soul, my body, all to me 
pertaining, didst Thou not take as Thine own, 
Thou like a mountain strong! when me Thou mad'st Thy slave? 
And this day is there any hindrance found in me?
Our mighty One! Eight-arm'd and Triple-eyed! 
Do Thou to me what's good alone, or do Thou ill, 
To all resigned, I'm Thine and wholly Thine!</em>

<em>Me dog, and lower than a dog, all lovingly 
Thyself didst take for Thine. This birth-illusion's thrall 
Is plac'd within Thy charge alone. And I in sooth, 
is there aught I need beyond that, with care search out? 
Herein is there authority at all with me? 
Thou may'st again consign me to some mortal frame; 
Or'neath Thy jewelled foot may'st place me, Brow-eyed One!</em>

<b>Pidiththa paththu 7</b>
<em>O Mother! My Father! Diamond beyond comparison
	Ever precious nectar – yield of pure love!
To me, vile one, multiplier of evil deeds
	Living in this body – home of filth
You bestowed great Civan-hood!
	O Great Siva, my true Wealth
In this life I cling on to you firmly
	How can you possibly now rise and leave me behind?</em>

<b>Kulaa paththu 6</b>
<em>Like a bud on a branch, rounded flower then unripe fruit
Made ripe only to sour, my frame thus formed was saved!
My believing thought clings to Him as it ever has,
He who rules with joy over beautiful golden Tillai!</em>

The above verse intertwines the imagery of the lifecycle of a fruit, to the stages of human life, from infancy to adolescence, to the intermediate stage of adulthood compared to the unripe fruit with no taste qualities or usefulness. 


<b>Aanantha maalai 6</b>
<em>My King! Is it not Your duty to show Your grace?
	How can you allow me to anguish, lying at ruin’s door?
If You do not bid me to come to You
	Who else is here to calm my fears?
And those doomed to perish, devotees equal to me
	Is your indifference to us befitting of you?
O God who dances in the court of Thillai
	I tremble and shake – afford me Your comfort!</em>

Finally, the last song of the Thiruvasagam:

<b>Acchop pathigam 9</b>
<em>With those blind to true happiness, I too wandered
Yet he eradicated my threefold faults. He, the Primal Lord,
Who considered even me as worth something,
Like dog raised on palanquin
Accho! Thus my Mother has graced me!
Who else is as blessed as I?</em>
