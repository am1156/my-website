Manickavasagar is known most for his 658 bone melting songs, grouped together in the text known as the Thiruvasagam, widely considered the pinnacle of spiritual and religious expression. Just the mere mention of his name or of this text is enough to cause tears in the eyes of his devotees.  

Although his original name is unknown, we refer to him as Vathavoorar at the beginning of his life, as he was from the city of Vathavoor. His early years are shrouded in mystery although we can guess that he was well versed in scripture and the arts. He worked as the minister to the Pandiyan king for many years before one day being asked to go and buy horses. 

As he set out, he at one stage had to pass Thiruperunthurai which is where Sivan decided to reveal Himself for the first time. Surrounded by 99 devotees and wielding the Siva Gnana Bodham – a Saiva treatise – Sivan comes in the disguise of a guru and sits underneath the kuruntha tree. 

Manickavasagar feels an immense rush of love and adoration the very moment he sees the guru. He runs up to him and falls at his feet. Sivan, noting Manickavasagar’s purity of soul, gives him the highest grace possible, and places his feet on Manickavaasagar’s head. See this heart-rending line in the Sivapuranam:

<b>Sivapuranam Line 32</b>
<em>Truly I beheld Your golden Feet and today gained liberation!</em>

After submerging Manickavasagar in the flood of bliss, Sivan enacts a little drama. He erects an effulgence of light, and one by one sends all the 99 other devotees through it, towards salvation, in front of Manickavasagar’s very eyes. 

Yet after everyone else had left, Sivan looks at Manickavasagar, and tells him to stay on this earth. As Manickavasagar’s eyes rain tears and his body shakes and trembles, with hands folded in worship above his head he watches His Lord step into the pillar of light too leaving him behind. He sings thus:

<b>Thiruchchatagam Song 85 and 87</b>
<em>Partner of Her with eyes like the deer,
He who is unknowable to the boundaries of the Vedas,
sweet as honey and ambrosia, yet unknown to thought,
King who bears the lowly deeds of this wretch!
I lament telling my woes.
Your devotees have reached the great city,
I wander here outside with my falseness.</em>

***

<em>My Master, to me your slave, give me love unto your Feet.
Your devotees have reached the land of no return
yet outside I remain – like the blind cow
which lows with the village cows*
I am estranged from your Feet,
bewildered I weep!</em>

* As the village cows return from grazing and see their stables close by they call out for their calves. The blind cow which travels with them cannot see the stable nor its calves, but it calls out too. 

Manickavasagar thus weeps and weeps for the rest of the time he spends in his mortal human frame. He is known as அழுது அடியடைந்த அன்பர் (devotee who reached God’s foot by crying). Returning to his story, he decides to build a temple with the money given to him to buy new horses. 

He forgets his worldly duties and stays in Thiruperunthurai, doing services to the devotees of Sivan there. To appease the Pandiyan king however, he sends word that the horses will arrive in a couple days. 

The horses never did arrive, and the king calls onManickavasagar to arrive in court. Manickavasagar does and again reassures the king that the horses will arrive in a couple days. As that too doesn’t happen the king with no other choice imprisons Manickavasagar. Unable to stand the sight, Sivan Himself descends to save His devotee. 

Fashioning foxes into an army of the finest horses, and riding them Himself in disguise along with His host of ghouls and bhootams, He reaches the Pandiyan kingdom:

<b>Thiruppandip pathigam Song 9</b>
<em>For us to cross the sea 
    where mixes evil deeds and future births
came the great Pandiyanaar, mounted on horse – 
the Lord who melts the bones of his devotees.
When this, the girls slender as the flower creeper knew,
they stood still as trees, forgetting themselves and all else!</em>

The king rejoices when he sees the flood of pristine horses and releases Manickavasagar, knowing little what was to unfold that night. Keeping the new horses in the stable along with the horses he already had, the king went to bed, only to find that the new beasts had transformed back to their original form of foxes. 

The foxes broke out and created havoc all around the kingdom before eventually running away leaving the king empty-headed and irate.

Convinced this was the trickery of Manickavasagar, he sentences him to be laid on the scorching hot bank of the Vaigai river. Yet again Sivan comes to the rescue, calling upon the Vaigai river to rush in full force, cooling Manickavasagar, and in the process causing the city to flood. 

Needing a dam to be built, the king orders one able bodied man from every household to contribute to building their section. However, after all the available men had enlisted to help for a particular household, there was still the house of the elderly woman Vanthi which didn’t have a representative. Fearing punishment from the king she pleads with the Lord, who donning yet another disguise as a cooly worker, comes to Madurai. 

Vanthi sees him and with the joy of her prayer being answered rushes up to him and asks him to work for her. He agrees but says that he needs some form of compensation. He suggests the crumbs which fall off the pittu rolls which Vanthi makes and sells. 

With this agreement he sets out as if to work, but instead whiles his time away – singing, dancing, sleeping and distracting others from working. 

The dam was fully built except for the one section which was expected from Sivan the cooly worker, and seeing this the king decides to punish him. Let Vallalar tell the story, in a song sung about Manickavaasagar:

<b>Aaludiya adikal arunmaalai Song 9</b>
<em>O virtuous One, was it not for you
that the Lord who shares his frame with a damsel
came as the warrior seated upon the horse,
and carried both the earth of the Vaigai river,
as well as the wound of the stick
inflicted by the king?</em>

The wound that was carried by Sivan was felt by every being on earth including the king himself. It was then that he realised the cooly worker was none other than the Lord himself, enacting divine dramas for Manickavasagar. The king begs our sage for his forgiveness and sends him on his way on the path to salvation. 

Manickavasagar travels to various shrines, chief of which are Uttharakosamangai where he sings of receiving the sacred ash from Sivan, as well as Kazhukundram and Seekazhi where he gains vision of Sivan:

<b>Thirukkoththumbi Song 17</b>
<em>The skin of the tiger and soft garment,
ear ring and rolled palm leaf pendant,
holy ash – milky white and cool sandalwood paste,
He holds the trident,
and green parrot on bangled arms.
This is the ancient form* he wears,
O King dragon fly – go to Him and sing his praise.</em>

Notes: One can notice the attributes of both Sivan and his consort Parvati intertwined in this description. This is the form which Manickavasagar beheld – the half Sivan, half Parvati Ardhanaareeshwarar form. The tiger hide, ear ring, holy ash, and trident belong to Sivan, and the soft garment, palm leaf ear pendant, sandalwood paste, parrot and bangles belong to Parvati.

He finally reaches Thillai (Chidambaram), where he makes his final spiritual push to reach Sivan. As he thus spends his days in bliss of Siva attainment, a man one day approaches him. He asks Maanickavasagar whether he can sing poetry. 

When Manickavasagar affirms, the man takes out his scribe and a wad of palm leaves and requests Manickavasagar to recite his poetry so that it may be copied down. Starting with the Sivapuranam, Manickavasagar sings his whole corpus of poetry and falls down in a swoon, out of sheer bliss. 

The man leaves the bundle of palm leaves at the foot of the Nataraja statue and disappears into the night, leaving the priests of the temple to find it the next day. Before they can get to reading the poetry however they see a curious phrase inscribed into the palm leaves. 

“This was handwritten by He of the Golden Court, as dictated by Manickavasagar”. They realise that it was the handwriting of Sivan himself! They search all over for Manickavasagar, and once they find him, show him the palm leaves. 

His eyes stream tears and every bone of his being melts thinking of the grace of the Lord, and he rushes once more towards the Thillai temple, accompanied still by the priests. They ask him what the meaning of his works is, to which he simply points at the statue of Natarajar, and steps into the pillar of light which gushes forth, finally attaining mutthi.
