<p>Arunagiri is nowadays widely revered as one of the greatest Tamil poets. His popular life story is the ultimate sinner to saint redemption story. After losing his parents early in life, he went down the path of engagement with prostitutes and the complete waste of all his wealth towards sensual pleasures. Having debilitated his mental and physical health irreparably and being shunned from society he saw no other way to continue living. He resolved to climb the gopuram of the Annamalai Temple and jump off. However, by the divine grace of God he falls softly into the hands of Lord Murukan disguised as a young man, who convinces him that it is a sin to take one’s own life and instructs him to meditate on the Lord. 

After 12 years of intense devotion, he receives a vision of Murukan once again, who transforms Arunagiri’s diseased body into one of shining gold lustre and sparks the flow of genius poetry which Arunagiri accomplished in his lifetime. See how beautifully Arunagirinathar has captured this moment in his poetry (translated by Swami Anandavana):

<em>Kinkini thith thimi, thith thith
The anklets on the dancing feet jingled,
A sound that to other sounds
Closed my hearing.

The Kadamba garland that He wore
Suffused me with its cloying fragrance,
And my breath was held.

His moon-like countenance and tender smile
Caused such cheer and ecstasy
That my mind was lost.
For a moment He looked at me,
A cool liquid light poured out
From His long lotus eyes.

It filled my heart tasting like nectar
And I was lost to Him forever</em>

Unfortunately, it is quite impossible to determine how much of the legend is true. Compounding this, there are many different versions, with details which seem to contradict autobiographical details in Arunagiri’s poetry itself. Therefore, although the core of the story may be reliable, it cannot be dismissed that some details may have been added as recreations based on his poetry. 

No matter how hotly debated his history may be, it is undeniable that Arunagiri was the most devoted of bhaktas and the most skilled of poets. He was clearly a knowledgeable scholar in Tamil and Sanskrit texts and shows a particular affinity for the Kantar Puranam, Thirumanthiram, Kambar Ramayanam etc. He pilgrimaged all over the south of India singing at many Murukan shrines. 

His poetry is often a passionate cry for the grace of God such that he can let go of all worldly desires. It is both a detailed warning of the pitfalls of life as he himself had experienced in his youth, as well as the effervescing outpour of the beauty of the world and God. He finds joy in the vibrance of nature which is further reflected in the energetic spirit and rhythm of his poetry. He conceives of Murukan as a Guru, a parent, a lover, a child and as the heroic warrior.

He indulges in colourful descriptions of the landscape and fauna which is dear to Lord Murukan, but perhaps his most masterful accomplishment is in his portrayal of the formless.  Noteworthy is his ability to capture so succinctly the indescribable experience of God in his magnificent text, the Kantar Anuboothi.</p>
