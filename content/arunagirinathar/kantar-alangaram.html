The Kantar Alangaram or Ornamentation of Kantar is a collection of 100 songs (plus another 7 songs which may have been the work of a later hand). It is written in the incredibly complex kattaLaik kaliththuRai metre. 

The Alangaram consists of songs praising the beauty of Murukan, his peacock and his consort – the hunter girl Valli. It also contains many songs reiterating the condition of human life and how one should aim to live. Such a thought-provoking verse is given here:

<b>Song 18:</b> 
<em>Praise the Lord wielding the sharp radiant spear and 
always share with the poor
even just half of a broken rice, 
	and remember the truth that
like the body whose useless shadow
	cannot help you escape the sun,
SEE! the wealth you hold in your hands,
	is useless for that inevitable path after death.
</em>

The concept of vannam or the use of the colour of sounds to enhance the meaning content is used in a classic example, in the 92nd song of the Alangaram. It is a great example of Arunagiri’s use of alliteration. 

Verse 92: 
tho<b>Nd</b>ar ka<b>Nd</b>a<b>Nd</b>i mo<b>Nd</b>u<b>Nd</b>irukkum suththa njAnamenum
tha<b>Nd</b>aiyam pu<b>Nd</b>arikan tharuvAi! sa<b>Nd</b>a tha<b>Nd</b>avemsUr
ma<b>Nd</b>alan ko<b>Nd</b>u pa<b>Nd</b>a<b>Nd</b>ara<b>Nd</b>an ko<b>Nd</b>u ma<b>Nd</b>imi<b>Nd</b>ak
ka<b>Nd</b>uru<b>Nd</b>a<b>Nd</b>ar vi<b>Nd</b>OdAmal vElthotta kAvalanE

<b>Translation:</b> 
<em>The Lord who is thronged by devotees
who through their wise eyes partake in that pure bliss
Grant me your lotus feet adorned with the anklet!
	As the terrible Curan with mace in hand,
coveting the land of mortals
	and the land of the celestials, with haste approached
the devas were gripped by fear yet did not run away
	because of you - guardian who wields the spear </em>

The colour of the sounds in the verse reinforces the powerful beat and pace of a war scene. The alliteration of the hard <b>Nd</b> sound heightens the effect of the approach of the evil Curan while merging seamlessly with the meaning content of the words.

Now I have presented here some of the most famous verses from the composition. The following verse is one of the most beautiful. It is said that if there is a single song out of the 100 that one should memorise it is this one.

<b>Song 70:</b>
<em>Like vision to one’s eyes
	are His tender flowery Feet
and like speech to ever truthful voice
	are His divine names – O Muruka!
Protector against yield of evil deeds committed
	are His twelve shoulders
and unwavering company for that frightful, lonely journey*
	are His Radiant Spear and Peacock</em>

* Lonely journey refers to the path the soul takes after dying

Notice in this following verse the repetition of பட்டு அழிந்தது (pattu azhinthathu) as underlined in all 4 lines, which is a beautiful feature I have attempted to recreate in translation. Notice the subtlety in every iteration of அழிந்தது having a slightly different meaning. 

<b>Song 40:</b>
<em>As the leaping cel-fish destroyed
	the paddy fields and gardens of Senthoor
the love for sweet Kadamba garland melted away
	the minds of the girls with hips like creeper.
The Spear of the Great Peacock Rider destroyed
	the sea, the demon and the mountain
as the touch of His feet erased 
	the handwriting of Brahma on my head</em>

There are some spiritual ideas which I give a basic overview of. The sea, the mountain and the Curan or the demon are the 3 foes which Murukan conquered in his war and stand as metaphors for the 3 malas or stains of humans – karma (good and bad deeds of the past), maaya (illusory nature of life) and aanavam (arrogance). These must be conquered for an individual to reach the purity needed to attain God. Furthermore, Brahma, the “God of Creation” is said to write on every humans head their predetermined life, based on their good and bad karma which is what the last line refers to. This leads nicely to the next poem:

<b>Song 76:</b>
<em>O Warrior who threw his Spear upon the mountain - 
Kumara of Thanikai!
What crime have I done to the Creator – 
that he should knowingly
give me this head uncrowned by your beautiful, jewelled Feet
and eyes which don’t behold you
this tongue which sings not Your praises,
and these hands which do not worship you?</em>

The beauty of Murukan is also explored in depth. Arunagiri, although clearly capable of ingenious visualisations, at times revels simply in stringing together praises of Murukan as if in a word garland, such as in the 72nd song:

<b>Song 72:</b> 
<em>No faults will come of those who do not forget
He who is the Red One, Kantan, the King of the Red Spear 
who radiates in Thiruchengode, 
Patron of Tamil Literature, the Beloved of Valli, 
the wearer of beautiful Kadamba garlands 
and the rider of the Peacock</em>


Another notable verse is one concerning lust for sexual pleasures. Due to Arunagiri’s painful experiences early in his life he takes every opportunity to provide warnings for others against falling into the same trap. This section of a verse is a fascinating example for multiple reasons:

<b>Excerpt from Song 29:</b> 
	<em>Through the grace of the Lord of Valli,
	the hunter girl of the mountain, I held as a raft
	the strength of mind afforded to me
	to cross the poisonous sea of lust</em>
