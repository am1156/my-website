The Kantar Anuboothi’s (Experience of Kantar) beauty lies in its simplicity. It is perhaps most famous for its 51st song, which is revered as the peak of devotional poetry and is featured at the end of this section. The choice of Tamil words are much more familiar to a modern reader and don’t rely heavily on short one syllable words like the Antati did. 

Ethukai is maintained through each verse a technique where the second letter of each line in a verse (equivalent to a syllable in English) must be rhymes. Each verse fits to one of two approximate rhytmic patterns (this is a strict case of something called kali viruththam):

<b>Chandam 1:</b> tAnA tananA tananA tananA
<b>Chandam 2:</b> tananA tananA tananA tananA

The Kandar Anuboothi is much more measured than Arunagiri’s other works and is immortalised for compressing deep philosophical insights into 51 short quatrains. The poem feels autobiographical yet impersonal, as if putting the reader in Arunagiri’s position as he guides the reader through the same realisation of God that he experienced. 

A special feature is how elegantly Arunagiri interweaves praises of Valli, the consort of Murukan, as well as of the love story between the two. Valli is stationed in the millet fields, to protect the crops from peacocks and parrots looking for food. Murukan, due to her beauty (which is a metaphor for the purity of her soul) ventures into the kurinji region determined to declare his love. In the 40th verse, this scene is captured as only Arunagirinathar can:

<b>Song 40:</b> 
<em>I forget not the radiant spear which drives away evil
  yet still will I falter, unable to cease my familial attachments?
    In the water pools,
    	the waterfall,
the fields of green grass
and through the hunter’s sheds
You wandered, my Lord!</em>

This is yet another poem which is subtly untranslatable. The inherent desperation and anguish of wandering about in the aforementioned places not being able to find his dear Valli in the Tamil word திரிந்தவனே is noteworthy. Most songs in the Anuboothi fit into this style, with a mental reaffirmation, a prayer or a piece of spiritual advice in one half and then the glory of Murukan or Valli in the other half. 

Another stunning piece of imagery from the 36th song:

<b>Excerpt from Song 36:</b>
<em>The celestials, older than the Vedas
ornament their heads with your lotus feet
and yet on your head you place the feet
of the girl with form like a lightning creeper</em>

Murukan is characterised throughout the text as a tender lover and his status as a God is only enhanced by his accessibility to the lowly hunter girl Valli, who has no knowledge of scripture or yogic practices which are typically ascribed to the religious elitists. She is a simple girl with nothing but love for the Lord and is repeatedly used as a <b>metaphor for the common devotee</b>. 

Commentators of this poem frequently emphasise the importance of truly understanding this point. The Valli-Murukan marriage isn’t just a Puranam story but an occurrence achievable in this world and this life between such pure souls and God. 

Thus, a careful reading of the Kantar Anubooti reveals that at its crux it is as much an intricate and creative love poem between the soul and God as it is a spiritual guide. The 12th song is a famous example of how the two mesh together and is yet another example of how Arunagiri is incredibly skilled at writing short yet thought provoking verses:

<b>Song 12:</b>
<em>He is the thief who stole the daughter of the red deer*
He is the Great One, Murukan, who is beyond birth and death
“Be still, speak not” he said and at that moment
Amma! The world was not known to me</em>

*This is a reference to Valli being born of a red deer (according to the Sanskritic Puranas)

The song starts by  mentioning the Kantar Puranam (Legend of Kantar) story where Valli and Murukan share their secret love over an extended time and eventually elope (Murukan steals Valli). This is a common poetry writing device in the akapporul (love poetry) genre and is discussed widely in grammar texts.

Then Arunagirinathar shares the secret which was provided to him by Murukan, <b>சும்மா இரு சொல் அற</b> (Just be, speak not). This is a philosophy he repeats many times across his poetry and its simplicity hides the deep and beautiful inner meaning. The spiritual import of this phrase as felt by Arunagiri is immense, which is captured by the exclamation அம்மா! The effect of this simple word defies explanation and may be more appreciated by the native Tamil speaker. 

It would be remiss of me to not present the “climax” of the poem. Few can withhold their sympathy from Arunagiri when he asks Murukan whether he is capable of receiving the divine grace, and when that grace is bestowed upon him the resulting poem is thrilling and evocative. To this point let us consider the 6th, 23rd and the 44th songs respectively. If possible, read the following in Tamil, as there consist many phrases with an effect that’s hard to replicate in English such as கமழும் கழலே:

<b>Song 6:</b>
<em>Upon this heart of mine cold and hard as rock
  might your feet, beautiful as the lotus, blossom?
   O Compassionate one, one who with everlasting love
     falls at the feet of Valli and fulfills her every wish</em>

<b>Song 23:</b>
<em>Lost in my ignorance, unable to meditate on your feet
  am I destined to falter and perish? 
			Is this right?
Can this be fair?
O glorious one - with the sharp, powerful lance. 
O Virtuous Mountain!
He who embraces the girl with the form of lightning creeper</em>

<b>Song 44:</b>
<em>He is the warrior wielding the singular victorious spear, 
that Murukan graced my head with his divine feet – 
what compassion! Can it be described?
		In the millet fields 
and the Vedas
		In the hot forests of Vallimalai** 
on the celestials’ heads
		And in salvation!
His feet radiate</em>

* Notice the nuance in patham meaning both foot as well as purity in Tamil
**Vallimalai is considered the birthplace of Valli where the love story took place with Murukan

Perhaps the most famous song from the Kantar Anuboothi is the 51st and final song. This verse is energetic, rhythmic, thought-provoking, yet simple and beautiful in word content while still remaining elusive and quite impossible to describe.  I urge the reader to read the original verse or the transliteration and to contemplate its musicality:

<b>Verse 51:</b>
உருவாய் அருவாய் உளதாய் இலதாய் 
மருவாய் மலராய் மணியாய் ஒளியாய்க்
கருவாய் உயிராய்க் கதியாய் விதியாய்க்
குருவாய் வருவாய் அருள்வாய் குகனே!

<b>Transliteration:</b>
uruvAi aruvAi uLadhAi iladhAi
maruvAi malarAi maNiyAi oLiyAik
karuvAi uyirAik gadhiyAi vidhiyAik
guruvAi varuvAi aruLvAi guhanE!

<b>Translation: (by Kamil Zvelebil)</b>:
<em>You who have form and who are formless,
you who are both being and non-being,
who are the fragrance and the blossom,
who are the jewel and its lustre,
who are the seed of life and life itself,
who are the mode and act of existence,
who are supreme guru, come
and bestow your grace, O Guha</em>

I leave here legendary Tamil researcher Kamil Zvelebil’s remarks on this poem:

<em>“I suggest that this stanza is … perfection itself-as far as philosophic poetry goes-both in thought-content and in form: a whole philosophy is expressed in three lines of poetry which sounds like music. This is Arunakiri' s real greatness: he has reached extreme limits in his masterly use of the phonaesthetic qualities of Tamil, and such stanzas are therefore untranslatable”.</em>
