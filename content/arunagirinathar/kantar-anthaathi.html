<p>The Kantar Antati contains some of the finest poems sung by Arunagiri in terms of devotional quality. However, it is an extremely intimidating text for reasons which shall become clear. The challenges start with the word antati itself, which is itself quite untranslateable. Antam means end and ati means beginning. This is the crux of the antati arrangement. It is a beautiful innovation of Tamil poetry where the last syllable, word or even phrase of a verse becomes the start of the next. For example, if one song ends with செச்சைநல்கே and the next song starts with செச்சைய this would be an example of antati.

The Kantar Antati, like the Kantar Alangaram consists of 100 verses in the formidable kattaLaik kaliththuRai metre. Arunagiri’s vast vocabulary as well as the unmatched versatility of the Tamil language is on full display in this composition. For example, the letter ஐ (I) itself has over 20 meanings! 

The history behind the composition goes as follows. Once Arunagirinathar saw multiple people who had their ears cut off. Upon inquiring what had happened he came to know about a poet called Villiputhurar, who was inviting the great poets of the region to a competition. The rules involved both poets getting a chance to compose, while the other has to simultaneously listen, decode and write down the meaning of the poetry. If either poet cannot decode the meaning of a verse they lose and get their ears cut off. 

Due to Villiputhurar’s immense skill he had remained undefeated, yet unfazed by the risks Arunagirinathar accepts the competition’s rules. After successfully navigating Villiputhurar’s poetry, Arunagirinathar sings his Kantar Antati. Villiputhurar kept up for the first 53 verses, after which Arunagirinathar crafts an impossibly intricate and completely indescribable verse:

<b>Verse:</b>
திதத்தத்தத் தித்தத் திதிதாதை தாததுத் தித்தத்திதா
திதத்தத்தத் தித்த திதித்தித்த தேதுத்து தித்திதத்தா
திதத்தத்தத் தித்தத்தை தாததி தேதுதை தாததத்து
திதத்தத்தத் தித்தித்தி தீதீ திதிதுதி தீதொத்ததே

<b>Transliteration:</b> 
titattattat tittatt tititAtay tAtatut tittattitA
titattattat titta titittitta tEtuttu tittitattA
titattattat tittattai tAtati tEtutai tAtatattu
titattattat tittitti tItI titituti tItottatE

<b>Meaning:</b> O Murukan, the blissful form who is praised by the Hindu Trinity of Nataraja the primordial dancer, Brahma who is knowleadgeable of the Vedas and Tirumal who is fond of resting on the celestial snake Adisesan and enjoys the yogurt produced in Brindavanam. You are the fond husband of the parrot like Devaiyanai. My mortal body clothed by skin, is liable to perish due to the cycle of death and rebirth. Before it is cremated by fire you must grant me the knowledge to meditate on your lotus feet and gain liberation. 

(All translations in this section were given originally by PR Natarasan in his book as well as the commentary by S. Nadarajan, I have attempted to give these explanations in English).

Completely blindsided by this verse Villiputhurar accepts defeat but Arunagiri out of his compassion doesn’t inflict any punishment on him. There are two main techniques which make this poem impossible to read except for erudite scholars. These are known as yamakam and tiribu.

<div class="big-center"><b>Yamakam</b></div>
This is best illustrated by example. Tamil poetry is not written word by word but rather seer by seer, where seer are combinations of syllabic units (for more details refer to the appendix). Words can spread across multiple seers. The idea is that across the 4 lines of a song the multiple seers at the beginning of  each line reads the same, but the separation of the individual words differs. A nice example is the 51st song:

<b>Verse:</b>
சிகைத்தோகை மாமயில் |வீரா சிலம்புஞ் சிலம்பம்புரா
சிகைத்தோகை மாமயில் | வாங்கிப் பொருது திசைமுகன்வா
சிகைத்தோகை மாமயில் | வானில்வைத் தோய்வெஞ் செருமகள்வா
சிகைத்தோகை மாமயில் | செவ்விநற் கீரர்சொற் றித்தித்ததே

<b>Word-by-word:</b> 
சிகை தோகை மா மயில் வீரா சிலம்பும் சிலம்பு
அம்புராசி கை தோகை மா மய் இல் வாங்கி பொருது திசைமுகன்
வாசி கைத்து ஓகை மாமய் இல் வானில் வத்தோய் வெஞ் செரு மகள்
வாசி கைத்தோ கைமா மாயில் செவ்வி நற்கீரர் சொல் தித்தித்ததே

Here the underlined letters are words which come from the end of the previous line and are put on the next line to complete the word.

<div class="big-center"><b>Tiribu</b></div>
A further complication occurs in the puNarchi vidhi (laws governing the joining of words). In some cases, this can change the fundamental construction of the words beyond recognition and requires a deep understanding from the reader to decipher. A basic example:
<b>கள் + நன்று</b> (kaL + nanRu) = <b>கண்ணன்று</b> (kaNNanRu)
Here the <b>ள்</b> (L) sound is pronounced by curling the tongue up to the roof of the mouth. The <b>ந</b> (na) sound is pronounced with the tongue at the roof of the teeth. However, when combining the two words the <b>ந</b> absorbs the same production mechanism as the <b>ள்</b> and so it changes to <b>ண</b> which is the version of the n letter produced by curling the tongue to the roof of the mouth. 

<div class="big-center"><b>Nayaki nayaka bhavam</b></div>
After combing through the many inherent challenges, the result is discovering that the Kantar Antati is a crown jewel of devotional poetry. A beautiful aspect of this composition is something called akapporul or nayaki-nayaka bhavam. This is considered to be the highest form of devotion, and has been explored by many great poets, most notably Manickavasagar. Over 30 of the 100 songs have been written with an akapporul message. 

The poet imagines him/herself as a young woman in love with God and can sing of the many stages of their relationship. Particularly common topics are the pains of separation, the boundless joy of union or the sharing of secrets with a friend. Even playful quarrelling with God about domestic problems has been handled! Although this may seem unusual, the effect is beautiful as we will see in the following examples. The word-by-word separation has been provided. Again, underlined words come from the end of the previous line:

<b>65th Verse:</b>
திகைப்பள் தங்க புயம் தந்தருளான் என்பள் திங்கள்
நியதி கைப்பள் தம் கத்து அமையார் செந்திலார் என்பள் தென்னன்
உயதி கைப்பு அடங்க புகல் சேய் என்பள் கன்னி கண்ணீர் தர
விதி கைபடு அங்கத்து அமையாது எம் ஐ ஆட்கொளும் சீகரமே

<b>Meaning:</b> Our Lord! Beautiful one! My daughter is saddened, and as tears falls she says “Thiruchendur’s king* does not listen to me and relieve my worries. He who cured Koon Pandiyan** of his ailment doesn’t grant me his strong chest for me to hug.” She falters as she sees the cool moon rising in the sky. You must grace her such that she is no more pained by worldly life.  

 * Thiruchendur is where one of the oldest and most popular Murukan temples is located. 
** The story of Koon Pandiyan being cured is repeated multiple times in the Antati and is one of the most important legends in the story of the Saiva saint Sambandar, who Arunagiri firmly equates to Murukan himself. 

This is a fascinating song written from the point of view of the lover girl’s mother, who is touched by her daughter’s suffering. The most interesting point is the girl’s enmity with the moon. We need to understand some aspects of Tamil love literature to proceed. The landscapes of Tamil literature are split into 5 tracts: kurinchi – mountain region, mullai – forest region, marutam – farm tracts, neytal – coastal region and paalai – desert region. Each of these landscapes has an associated akam and puram theme (love and war respectively).

Murukan has been worshipped, as early as the Tolkappiyam of about 2000 years ago (and likely much longer), as the God/guardian of the kurinchi region. Here the love theme is the secret union of lovers, and the war theme is cattle raid or millet theft. This is referenced here as kurinchi poems usually involve the hero and the heroine falling in love and with the help of their confidants setting up secret meetings in the dead of the night without the knowledge of their family members or the other people in their community. Therefore, the implied context is that the girl sees the moon rising, indifferently to her pain, and is constantly reminded of a previous time when she would enjoy the company of her lover, Murukan. This causes her to dislike the moon. 

This time the verse is from the point of view of the girl and details her heartbreak at having been left behind by her lover. It is an interesting form of love poetry, where the conversation is between the girl and a singing bard. 

<b>76th Verse:</b>
செம் மலை வண்டு உகள் தரங்கம் மா வென்ற திண் படை வேல்
செம்மலை வண் துவச வாரணத்தானை செப்ப உன்னி
செம்மலை வண்டு தவு அம் தமிழ் பாண தெள் தீம் கையில் வாய்
செம்மலை வண்டு விருப்புறுமோ இது தேர்ந்து உரையே

<b>Meaning:</b> Without any flaws you sing about me in such sweet music, O Panar*. Answer me this – are bees attracted to old flowers even if they are at merely a hand’s length? I am like an old flower to Murukan which is why he has forsaken me. So instead, you shall sing about the glory of the warrior with the rooster flag who destroyed the evil Curan who stood as a mango amidst the ocean and the mountain which harboured his clan. 

* A pANar is a bard, who usually sings praises of the king, God, or in this case about the beautiful lover girl. 

Another interesting situation arises from the lover girl trying to discreetly hide the marks of her union with Murukan from her confidant and friend. The implicit context is that upon being questioned the girl says, “I just went to bathe in the waters of Thiruchendur”, to which the friend provides this remark:

<b>42nd Verse:</b>
தீ நந்து இனத்து உதர செல்வர் பால் சென்று எனக்கு என்பது ஓர்
தீனம் தினத்தும் உதரானலம் சுட சேர்ந்து சுடும்
தீ நம் தினத்துனி களை செங்கோட்டினன் செந்தில் அம் நீர்
தீன் நத்தின் அத்து உதவு துப்பு இரசதம் செய்ய வற்றே

<b>Meaning:</b> The beautiful waters of Thiruchendur where the King of the Spear presides, has the power to destroy the hunger which arises from poverty and burns inside one’s body daily. Hmm! Can it also turn the lips of this girl, red as coral, into those white as the conch shell?

The next verse is almost like a challenge set to Murukan by the friend of the girl. It is in reference to the practice of madal ERuthal, which is undertaken by the hero when the heroine and her relatives are averse to a relationship forming. He draws the girl in all her beauty on a cloth and hoists it as a flag on top of a chariot made of palmyra and parades through the village to declare his love. 

<b>71st Verse:</b>
… செந்தில் அன்னாள்
தீங்கு அளும் மாசு உண் நமன்போல் விழியும் செழும் கரும்பும்
தீம் களும் மாசுண நன்றான மாற்றமும் தீட்டின் நன்றே

<b>Meaning:</b>
This girl, radiant like the City of Thiruchendur, has eyes as fierce as the God of death who investigates the faults of humans, and has voice beyond comparison – sweeter than even sugar cane and honey. Draw this on your madal if you can.</p>
