Arunagirinathar is undeniably most famous for his collection of Thiruppugazh. Although he is said to have written over 16000 such poems, we currently have about 1300 available to us today. The Thiruppugazh is most notable for the handling of chandam. 

<div class="big-center"><b>Chandam</b></div>
The chandam is a strict rhythmical pattern based on syllabic quantity which Arunagiri religiously adheres to across his corpus of the Thiruppugazh. The tala structure is determined by the combination of short and long syllables in the first line and then replicated across the whole poem. While the chandam was first employed by Sambandar and Thirumazhisai Azhwar from the 7th century onwards, Arunagiri was the poet who took this form to its glorious peak. His deep mastery of rhythm  in combination with an incredibly immense vocabulary allowed him to handle previously unimaginable patterns. Musicologist T Sankaran has dubbed him the “unrivalled master of chandam”. A very intricate and skilful example is given. Try reading the chandam and then reading the verse to the rhythm to understand the skill of the poet and the effect on the listener:
<b>Chandam:</b>
tanana  tanaatana  tanana  tanaatana  tayya  tanatta  tanta
   taanaatana  taanan  taanana ….. tantataanaa

<b>Transliteration:</b> 
vathana  sarOruka  nayana  sileemuka  vaLLi  punaththil  ninRu
   vArAypathi  kAthang  kAtharay …… yonRumUrum. 

<div class="big-center"><b>Tongal</b></div>
Here it is important to note an artistic innovation which Arunagiri is well known for. The concept of the tongal is a short extension to the chandam added as a clear separation between consecutive verses. It is separated by ellipsis and  can be seen usually in the form ‘…… tana taa naa’. Although seemingly innocuous its effect is undeniable. It is typically filled with a plea asking for God’s grace such as aruLvAyE or purivAyE, or an epithet for Murukan such as mayilveerA (warrior with the peacock) and vadivElA (He who has the beautiful spear). The ending of every line on an elongated sound lends to the feeling of an impassioned cry for help and contributes significantly to the emotional appeal of the Thiruppugazh. 

<div class="big-center"><b>Conception of God</b></div>
Arunagirinathar’s conception of Murukan is rich and diverse allowing him to explore the maximum potential of his poetic skill. One can’t help but yearn to see Murukan’s beautiful dancing form when one sings the famous thaNdai aNi veNdaiyam, for instance. 

Similar to the discussion of nayaki-nayaka bhavam in the Kantar Antati section, Arunagiri has sung a collection of Thiruppugazh poems, which also view Murukan as a lover, while the poet imagines themselves as a girl, wishing for union. These poems are quite a bit rarer but just as beautiful. This particular poem begins with the words, kOla maRai, and the first half of it is presented:

<b>Translation:</b> 
<em>
Because of the beautiful one without a body,
    that relentless spirit 
    who comes in the evening
    the God of Love, who shoots his
    flowery arrows at me

Because of the dense forests, 
    filled with luscious trees, 
    home to the cuckoo
    whose powerful, ringing cry 
    haunts me

Because of the moon which flings 
    its poisonous rays of light
    and, like the hottest of fires 
    burns me

Because of my wilting spirit, 
    You must come daily
    and give me your love 
    and embrace me
</em>

Next is a relatively famous poem starting with the words iruvar mayalO, glorifying the grandeur of Murukan and viewing him as both the fierce warrior and protector of the celestials as well as the spiritual Guru who condescended to save Arunagiri’s life:

<b>Translation:</b> 
<em>Is it the love for your two consorts? 
Or are you amidst the festivals of your devotees?
What is keeping you away from me?
When even the revered sages, Vishnu and the celestials 
who could not attain you
cried for your grace, 
did it fall on your ears?
O, I am the lowly one, who begs of You, 
lest these words go to waste
is there anyone compassionate enough
to speak on my behalf?
***
A mountain on this earth 
is a mere speck of dust on your feet 
Is there a shore to your sea of grace?
You Radiate as the Great Master of all the Universe, 
You are the minute one who Glides 
as the motion within an atom
You Wield the five Elements of the Earth 
as your weapons
You are that which is present in all!
O oldest of forms, warrior with the spear
When the great Vishnu and Brahma surrendered to you
You protected the celestials, 
and pierced through the veil of darkness
Even when I, your slave, had contracted 
that incurable disease you eradicated my faults
O Great One who resides in Annamalai!</em>

An unmissable point is the unique poem starting with the words jega mAyai utRe. The first half of it is presented below:

<b>Translation:</b> 
<em>In this illusory life, bound to family, 
    I have a wife in whose womb you shall form
You will grow for 10 months and possess
    the beautiful shape of a child – my treasure! Object of my love!
I will place my forehead on your forehead, my eye on your eye
    and cherish your embrace of my mountain-like shoulders
And when I place you on my lap everyday, O playful child
    you shall kiss me with your divine mouth precious as diamonds</em>

This is a beautiful poem, where God is visualised as the child of the poet. Although this by itself is not uncommon, and is its own form of poetry called Pillai Tamil, the genius of this Thiruppugazh is how human the interaction is. It is a masterful exercise in creativity and the vivid imagery of the relation between doting father and newborn tugs at one’s heartstrings. The final line of the poem contains a double meaning impossible to replicate. முத்தி means both kiss as well as the Hindu concept of liberation from the otherwise endless cycle of rebirths.
