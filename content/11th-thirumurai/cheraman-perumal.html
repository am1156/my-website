I have deliberately not given a name for the Cera King in the Thirumugappasuram section. That’s because we don’t know for sure which King it was. 

The most likely guess, and the answer given by the Periya Puranam however, is Ceraman Perumal Nayanar, who is also one of the 63 Nayanamars as well as a poet in the 11th Thirumurai.

Although he was a great, powerful king, he was as humble as a common man and a great devotee of the Lord. For example, during his coronation ceremony he adorned the crown and mounted the royal elephant as part of the royal procession. 

As he circled around the shrine of the Lord he saw a washerman coming in the opposite direction, carrying clay on his shoulders. Due to the rain, the clay had liquidised and started dripping all over the washerman’s body. 

Ceraman, seeing the man from afar, took the clay to be holy ash smeared all over the man’s body. In swelling love he jumped down from his elephant and stood before the washerman, bowing in prayer. 

Due to such devotion he was blessed with a very unique gift. After his daily prayers he would hear the tinkling sound of Sivan’s anklets (silambu) as He dances in the Divine Court. One such day he finished his prayers, expectant of the anklet sound, but it didn’t come. 

Thinking that it was a result of some crime he had unknowingly committed, Ceraman despaired and resolved to end his life. Unsheathing his sword and drawing it to his chest he was about to carry out his intention when the music of the anklets came in a hurry. 

“O Lord, why were you late today?” asked Ceraman, to which Sivan replied in a bodiless voice, “Sundarar, our great devotee, hailed us with a musical pathigam in Thillai. I was immersed in his bhakthi.”

Hearing this Ceraman was gripped with a desire to see Sundarar. There formed a deep bond of friendship between the two, which carried on till their last days on this earth. 

When it came time for Sundarar to leave this world and rejoin Kailai Mountain, Sivan sent for him a white elephant. As he mounted it and rode through the skies, Ceraman became aware of the happenings. 

He took one of his horses, capable of ascending the heavens due to it hearing the sacred five letter mantrams and raced to catch up to Sundarar. Catching up to the elephant and even travelling ahead of it, Ceraman reached Kailai Mountain first and with Sundarar entered the presence of Sivan. There he composed a long song in the form of the ulaa, and with Sivan’s permission, recited it before all that were present there.  

This scene is depicted on the image to the left, a temple drawing in Thanjai Perunkoyil. The trunk of the elephant is visible behind Ceraman on his horse.

Three of Ceraman’s compositions have come down to us namely:
1. Ponvannaththu anthaathi
2. Thiruvaaroor mummanikkovai
3. Kayilaaya gnaana ulaa

<div class = "big-center"><b>Ponvannath thanthaathi</b></div>
Pon vannam means gold colour and anthaathi is a technique where the last word or phrase of a song becomes in some way the start of the next song. Pon vannam forms part of the name as this is how the poem both starts and ends. 

The composition contains 100 songs, and is known for the many beautiful songs cast in the nayaki-nayaka bhaavam where the poet imagines himself as a young girl pining for union with the Lord, her lover. For example, in the 34th song, the nursing mother speaks the following:

<b>Ponvannath thanthaathi Song 34:</b>
<em>He is the Leader who rides the Bull, 
after giving rulership of the World to his devotees.
Yet why does he make this girl languish,
	as she of long spear-like eyes
	petite feet and white teeth covered by rosy lips
wilts like slender waist – without food or sleep
desiring nothing but the garland wrapped around His head?</em>

Ceraman is talking about his own history in the first two lines. The deeper implied suggestion is that such devotees are raised on the grand royal elephant, yet Sivan merely takes the bull as his vehicle. Despite showing such compassion to others, the nursing mother of the young lover girl asks why the Lord is indifferent in this case. 

<div class = "big-center"><b>Thiruvavur Mummanikkovai</b></div>
This is a composition of 30 songs set in the <em>agam</em> genre of Tamil poetry. This is slightly different from the nayaki-nayaka bhaavam of the previous poem, as here the fact that the young girl's lover is Sivan is not explicitly said. Instead the poet sings about various situations which arise in general between a young maiden and her lover.

<em>Mum</em> - three, <em>mani</em> - gem, <em>kovai</em> - garland. The three gems refer to the three forms of poetic form which are intertwined in a garland like pattern, namely <em>asiriyappa</em>, <em>venpa</em> and <em>kattalaik kaliththurai</em>. The asiriyappa, although longer poems, are the most beautiful.

For example, the first song contains a poetic introduction to the heroine. The couple are in married life, yet the hero parts from her to ply his trade and gain wealth, leaving her with the solemn promise that he would be back before the advent of the rainy season. 

Ceraman paints a picture through the words of the confidant as she sees the heroine’s heartbreak at seeing black clouds gather in the sky as they start to sprinkle raindrops. 

<b>Thiruvarur Mummanikkovai Song 1: </b>
<em>Seeing the black clouds rise upon the summits of the hills
after drinking the muddy waters of the wide seas
and seeing them shower fine raindrops,
this damsel with bright ornaments sighs like the northern winds.
Her golden earrings flash as her eyebrows arch like the bow,
and her beauteous rosy lips are coloured like the cochineal insect.
Her hands are like kantal flowers, 
and her pearly teeth blossom like the bud of the jasmine.
Her locks of hair is decked with fruit of the cassia tree,
as the pale pallor spread across her body is golden
and her pretty appearance is soft like the peacocks’.
Tears cascade from her eyes, as her collyrium
is washed away, flooding down her breasts
staining her jewellery of gold, gems and faultless diamond,
as if imitating a great deluge – O Lady,
like the sacrificial altar of the Lord of Arur
	who’s matted hair contains the flow of the Gangai River,
	the Leader who shares half his body with his consort,
is the heart of he who has parted from us, our lover*,
wrought too of stone?</em>

* The heroine and her confidant are so close that they commonly share personal pronouns in Tamil literature. They are two bodies containing the same life. 

The scene changes in the 27th song. The couple are now back in the secret phase of their love before marriage, and the hero desires to sneakily meet his beloved in the night. The confidant informs him of the ideal meeting place, and hurries to tell the heroine of the arranged tryst.

<b>Thiruvarur Mummanikkovai Song 27:</b>
<em>As even nocturnal birds and ghosts slumber,
and the snowy dead of the night drags on
his chariot wheels around and around
like the minds, forever melting in devotion,
	of those who worship the fiery-red Lord
	who holds the leaping deer in his hand.</em>

<div class="big-center"><b>Thirukkaiyilaaya gnaana ulaa</b></div>
The ulaa is one of the 96 versions of sitrilakkiyam in Tamil literature. It is an interesting conception where the subject of the poem, whether that be a king or a God even, is bathed and decked carefully with choice jewels and ornaments. 

They then go on a royal procession around the city, mounting the royal elephant or a chariot, as music resounds on all sides and poets sing praise. 

The poem concerns itself with the 7 age classes of women, from young girls to middle aged women. It describes in 7 stages how each class becomes enamoured and love sick seeing the physical might and handsomeness of the hero. Needless to say the gnaana ulaa details a spiritual love between the hero (Sivan) and the women (souls).
