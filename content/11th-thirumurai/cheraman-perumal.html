I have deliberately not given a name for the Cera King in the Thirumugappasuram section. That’s because we don’t know for sure which King it was. 

The most likely guess, and the answer given by the Periya Puranam however, is Ceraman Perumal Nayanar, who is also one of the 63 Nayanamars as well as a poet in the 11th Thirumurai.
Although he was a great, powerful king, he was as humble as a common man and a great devotee of the Lord. For example, during his coronation ceremony he adorned the crown and mounted the royal elephant as part of the royal procession. 

As he circled around the shrine of the Lord he saw a washerman coming in the opposite direction, carrying clay on his shoulders. Due to the rain, the clay had liquidised and started dripping all over the washerman’s body. 

Ceraman, seeing the man from afar, took the clay to be holy ash smeared all over the man’s body. In swelling love he jumped down from his elephant and stood before the washerman, bowing in prayer. 

Due to such devotion he was blessed with a very unique gift. After his daily prayers he would hear the tinkling sound of Sivan’s anklets (silambu) as He dances in the Divine Court. One such day he finished his prayers, expectant of the anklet sound, but it didn’t come. 

Thinking that it was a result of some crime he had unknowingly committed, Ceraman despaired and resolved to end his life. Unsheathing his sword and drawing it to his chest he was about to carry out his intention when the music of the anklets came in a hurry. 

“O Lord, why were you late today?” asked Ceraman, to which Sivan replied in a bodiless voice, “Sundarar, our great devotee, hailed us with a musical pathigam in Thillai. I was immersed in his bhakthi.”

Hearing this Ceraman was gripped with a desire to see Sundarar. There formed a deep bond of friendship between the two, which carried on till their last days on this earth. 

When it came time for Sundarar to leave this world and rejoin Kailai Mountain, Sivan sent for him a white elephant. As he mounted it and rode through the skies, Ceraman became aware of the happenings. 

He took one of his horses, capable of ascending the heavens due to it hearing the sacred five letter mantrams and raced to catch up to Sundarar. Catching up to the elephant and even travelling ahead of it, Ceraman reached Kailai Mountain first and with Sundarar entered the presence of Sivan. There he composed a long song in the form of the ulaa, and with Sivan’s permission, recited it before all that were present there.  

This scene is depicted on the image to the left, a temple drawing in Thanjai Perunkoyil. The trunk of the elephant is visible behind Ceraman on his horse.

Three of Ceraman’s compositions have come down to us namely:
1. Ponvannaththu anthaathi
2. Thiruvaaroor mummanikkovai
3. Kayilaaya gnaana ulaa
