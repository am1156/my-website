The sacred 12 Thirumurais of Saiva literature are a categorisation of devotional poetry by different people from different periods of time, ranging from the Age of the Sangam to the mid 11th century. Each thirumurai has a defining characteristic about it: 

1. The first 7 thirumurais (thevaaram) are pannisai (musical songs)
2. The 8th (thiruvaasagam, thirukkovaiyaar) is Literature Tamil, filled with poetic brilliance and innovations. 
3. The 9th (thiruvisaippa, thiruppallaandu) are jubilant, sprightly hymns of praise. 
4. The 10th (thirumanthiram) is known for its yogic and spiritual exposition. 
5. The 12th (periya puraanam) is a grand epic of 4286 songs which beautifully recounts the life histories of 63 nayanmars (devotees) of Siva. 

So what is the speciality for the 11th Thirumurai (sitrilakkiyam)? It contains all of the qualities listed above! From pannisai songs such as Kaaraikkaal Ammaiyaar’s Aalangaadu Thiruppathigam to the thirumarams which recount the history of Kannappa naayanaar, the 11th Thirumurai touches almost every form of devotional poetry in the other thirumurais.

The very first composition in the 11th Thirumurai itself is a completely unique poem, because it was written by none other than Lord Siva himself! We will look at some of these unique compositions throughout this website.
