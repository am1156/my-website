<div class="big-center"><b>Overview</b></div>
Ammaiyar’s genius revolutionized the Tamil poetic scene. Her poems are included in the 11th Thirumurai of Saiva poetry. The Thirumurais are as follows:

Within the 11th Thirumurai, her compositions are fourfold:
1.	Thiruvaalangaadu Mootha Thiruppathigam
2.	Mootha Thiruppathigam
3.	Thiruvirattai Manimaalai
4.	Arputha Thiruvanthaathi

The sheer weight of her contribution through these poems is immense. Karaikkal Ammaiyar was possibly the first bhakthi poet, trailblazing the path forward for centuries worth of devotees starting with the Tevaram Moovar. 

She was the first to employ the anthathi construction, a device where the letters, words or a phrase which finishes one poem, also comes as the start of the next poem. For example:

<b>Arputha Thiruvanthathi Songs 1 and 2</b>
<em>Since birth, from the moment I began to speak,
	in love I reached your roseate Feet – dark throated
	Lord of the Celestials! 
What day will You remove my misery?
	                                ***
Misery He may not solve, He may not pity me either
or reveal the path to salvation, yet – He of luminous form
Our Lord who dances in the fire, decked with bones,
for Him, the love in my heart shall never decrease.</em>
	
Her love for the Lord is boundless, as seen in her poetry, and she uses this intimate relationship to chide Sivan as if he were her own son. It was also her wish to forever behold the dance enacted by Sivan in the cemetery grounds; the following song combines these two aspects:

<b>Arputha Thiruvanthathi Song 51</b>
<em>Don’t fare forth united beautifully with the bangled one,
who’s locks flow down her nape – as the kazhal rings
to Your fiery cemetery dance in the dead of the night
along with Your gang of ghosts</em>

<b>Notes:</b>
united – the song is about Sivan who is pictured as sharing his frame with Parvati. Ammaiyar warns Him that his soft and tender consort might be frightened by the sights of the cemetery dance.
kazhal – a sort of ornament for the feet which warriors wear.


She was also the first to employ the extremely difficult kattalaik kaliththurai metre. Revered nowadays as one of the most musical poetic forms in Tamil literature, it involves each line having a certain fixed number of syllables, housed in the very constrictive venpa metre. 

The Thiruvirattaimani maalai is so called as it weaves pairs of kattalaik kaliththurai poems with venpa poems in an alternating fashion, much like a flower garland. One such poem:

<b>Thiruvirattaimani Maalai Song 5</b>
<em>What will you do, if your half – 
the mountain girl * of the roseate lips
	finds she who is known as Gangai
	in your long, matted hair?
With bow in your hand, you sent an arrow 
    towards the warring triple cities, engulfing them in fire. 
    Sankara of matchless power!</em>

<b>Notes:</b> Parvati is the daughter of the mountain king and shares half of Sivan’s body. However, Sivan, in an act of grace, also carries the flood of the Gangai River in his hair. Ammaiyar playfully asks Him how he manages the two consorts.

<div class="big-center"><b>Influence</b></div>
The most revered of all the Saiva poets are the Naalvar, namely Sambandar, Appar, Sundarar and Manickavasagar, who between them combine for the first 8 of the 12 thirumurais. The Thevaaram Moovar sang almost exclusively in the form of pathigams (groups of ten songs). Between the three of them, they account for about 8000 songs which have survived to this day (and uncountably more which have unfortunately been lost). 

In the Thiruvaasagam sung by Maanickavaasagar too, the majority of compositions are in the pathigam format. This format was innovated by Karaikkal Ammaiyaar.

Moreover, at the end of such groups of 10, it is customary to sing a song which states the benefit of singing that pathigam. The first person to handle such a concept was Karaikkal Ammaiyar. For example, from the mootha thiruppathigam:

<b>Mootha Thiruppathigam Song 11</b>
<em>By the grace of the Lord
    whos locks are crowned with crescent moon,
    and who enacts his divine dance
    with snake belt wrapped around his waist
the ten songs of the ghoul of Karaikkal – 
who inhabits the forest with fiery, sharp toothed mouth,
will eradicate the sins of those who sing and dance.</em>

In fact, it is even said that Thirugnanasambandar sung his first pathigam Thodudaiya Seviyan in the pann (musical setting) of Nattapadai to pay homage to Karaikkal Ammaiyar, who also started her poetry corpus in the same pann.

<div class="big-center"><b>Life</b></div>
Karaikkaal Ammaiyaar was born as the daughter of a wealthy merchant. The name given to her at birth was Punithavathiyaar (pure one), and she was said to be as beautiful as Lakshmi herself:

Her soft feet were fitted with bright jewels,
and even in her toddling stage
she held boundless love
for He who wears snakes as ornaments.
Even whilst playing she would praise the Lord,
and adore his servitors as they passed by,
thus her grace and beauty grew day by day.

The above are some lines from the Periya Puranam rendered in English. Coming back to her story, her father soon arranged her marriage to another merchant. He couldn’t bear to be separated from his daughter, beautiful as the peacock, and so he built the newlywed couple a mansion where they lived harmoniously, serving the devotees of Sivan. 

One day her husband was given two mangoes, which she kept safely in her house, to give him later. As her husband left for the day, there came a Sivan devotee, plagued by hunger. She welcomed him and performed all the rites, such as cleaning his feet, and offered him food, along with which she placed one of the mangoes that she had stored. 

The devotee left, and her husband came back. She did all her duties and served him food, at which point he asked her to bring one of the mangoes. Taking a liking to its taste, he asked for the other one too. As the other mango had already been given away, Punithavathi, unsure what to do, had no resort except the Rider of the Bull:
	
<em>She moved out to the next room dismayed,
what could she possibly do?
Oblivious of the world she meditated on the Feet of the Lord
and by his grace of grace
there appeared a mango of exceeding sweetness
in the hands of her with plaited hair</em>

She joyously took it to her husband, who tasted it and found it to be even greater than the first. “Where did you acquire this? Its taste is rare to be found anywhere in the 7 worlds” he asked, convinced it was not identical to the first mango. Unwilling to lie she told him the truth:

<em>She of perfumed flowery locks narrated the story
of the grace of the Lord 
with the poison stain in his throat,
yet he was still unconvinced, and said
“If it truly be the act of the lustrous One
with matted hair, divine another such mango”.
She moved out, and asked of the jewelled Lord
for another such mango, 
saying that otherwise her words
would become a mere falsehood,
and to her wonderment she beheld 
yet another mango in the palm of her hands</em>

She took it to her husband and placed it in his hand, but as he went to taste it, it vanished! Fearing his wife to be a supernatural woman, he hatched a secret plan. He mounted a ship loaded with wealth and acted as if going to a nearby land to trade and acquire wealth. 

Instead, he started a new life, making investments and starting a business, then marrying another woman. To them a child was born which he named Punithavathi in memory of his first wife.

When those back in Karaikkal came to know what had transpired they took it as their duty to unite Punithavathi with her husband. Carrying her on a diamond studded palanquin they trekked to that Pandya country:

<em>After some days they reached Pandyan Country
and her husband, fearstruck upon hearing of this
took his flower creeper-like second wife and child
to meet the lady of flowery locks.
Before his first wife, who stood soft as a young deer,
he bowed down, and said “I live by your grace,
and this, my tender child, bears your name”.
Struck by amazement her relatives asked,
“O he who wears fragrant garlands,
what makes you worship your wife thus?”
To which he replied “regular human she is not,
she is a divine deity, you too must understand this,
and worship her golden feet”.
Hearing this she hailed the Lord
who enjoys Konrai blossoms in his matted hair, 
and who dances wearing resounding anklets.
“If this be his intention, O Lord, 
rid me of this burden of beauteous flesh, 
which I bore only for the sake of my husband.
Grant me the form of a ghoul!”
At that very moment by the grace
of He who dances in the Divine Court,
she shook off her beauteous flesh
and stood as a hallowed ghoul,
fit to be worshipped by the earth and the heavens.
As flowers rained on the earth,
as the five celestial instruments rang in unison,
and as sages and the bhootas of Sivan danced in joy,
she started to hymn praise of the lotus feet of the Lord
and headed towards his divine abode in Mount Kailai.</em>

Not wanting to touch the holy land with her feet, she walks by her head. Taken aback by the sight Sivan’s consort, Parvati, asks him what the meaning of this is, to which comes the reply – a moment beautifully captured in the Periya Puranam: 

<em>“Behold Umai, she is like a mother who fosters us.
She asked for the boon of this wondrous form, 
which we graced unto her.”
As Punithavathi neared them,
Sivan beheld her and uttered that singular word
such that all the worlds stood redeemed,
“O Mother!”</em>

“O Father” she replied, before asking Sivan to grace her with the boon to adore his dancing form forever, a request Sivan grants. As Punithavathi had the status of being called “Mother” by Sivan Himself she became known as Karaikkal Ammaiyaar (Ammai – Mother). 

Thus was born Peyar (the Ghoul Devotee) – one of the most important devotees and poets in our Saiva history!
