Paanapaththiran was a renowned yazh player and an ardent devotee to the Lord. When a musician called Hemanatha Bhagavthar came to Pandiya Country and proclaimed that no other musician could rival him, the Pandiya King called upon Paanapaththiran to defeat Hemanathar in musical contest. 

Paanapaththiran prayed to Sivan, and confident that he would win, set out to gauge the level of his competition. When he reached the place Hemanathar was staying in he heard the students which accompanied Hemanathar on his journey doing their practice. 

Paanapaththirar was left speechless by their skill, and was convinced now that if the students were this good he would have no chance against the teacher. 

With no other option he went and prayed to Sivan again, and passed the night in despair wondering how he would go in the competition the next day. Hearing his prayers, Sivan came in the disguise of a wood cutter, carrying a load of firewood on his head. 

Wending his way through the streets of Madurai he came and rested outside the residence of Hemanathar. After laying the wood down, he started singing with a voice so melodious and grammatically perfect that Hemanathar out of amazement came rushing outside to see who was singing. 

Seeing a mere wood cutter he was stunned, and asked “who are you?” To this Sivan replied, “I am just a mere music enthusiast. I wanted to learn properly under Master Paanapaththiran, but he rejected me due to my inability. So, I just sing for fun.”

Hearing this Hemanathar was gripped with fear. Not wanting to go up against a music teacher that found a flaw in such perfect singing, he decided to abandon town that very day, thereby automatically forfeiting the competition. 

Everyone in the city woke up with anticipation of the showdown, but hearing of what had happened the previous night they all went to Paanapaththiran, confused. 

That was when Sivan revealed it was him that came the previous day, much to the delight of the Pandiya King, who bestowed innumerable gifts on the victorious Paanapaththiran. 

However, Paanapaththiran had little interest in worldly desires, and gave away almost all the gold and gems and expensive clothes he had received to his relatives as well as other devotees of the Lord. Left with nothing he once again lived in poverty.

Seeing the state of his dear devotee, Sivan decided to help him by every day stealing a little from the locked and guard vault of the Pandiya King. 

Every day Paanapaththiran would sing at the Madurai temple and receive his share of wealth, without even realising that it was Sivan who was giving it to him. 

As this continued for some time, one day Paanapaththiran finished his daily prayers to find that there was no riches left for him that day. Fearing that his prayers were inadequate he begged Sivan for an explanation. 

At that moment Sivan spoke from the heavens, explaining that he had been stealing from the King to help Paanapaththiran all this while and that if he stole anymore the King would get suspicious seeing the reducing treasures. 

However, still wanting to make sure Paanapaththiran did not suffer in poverty, Sivan decided to write a letter, in the form of a poem. The poem is as follows:

<div class = "big-center"><b>Thirumugappaasuram</b></div>
<em>Amidst the mansions of Koodal where the moon rests in joy,
as swans with milk-white striped feathers
roam through the groves,
in Aalavaay I, Sivan, reside, and these are my words:

Like the clouds of rain season,
you give generously to bards skilled in poetry.
Under the coloured moon-white royal umbrella,
you mount and ride steeds, ready for war.
O Ceralan, Behold!

Paanappaththiran, the yazh player,
is a devotee of mine very much like yourself. 
He is coming to see you, 
and you must give him great riches and send him back.</em>

Notice how structured the letter is. First the greatness of the city (Koodal) followed by the greatness of the temple (Aalavaay). Then Sivan introduces himself, declaring that these are his very own orders. He reminds Ceralan of his generosity towards poets, as liberal as the cloud which rains, expecting nothing in return. 

e also praises Ceralan’s skill in war and the greatness of his rulership (which is shown by the reference to the royal umbrella). All this done, he finally introduces the reason for writing the letter. 

Sivan directed the musician to head to the nearby lands and hand the King this letter. The Cera King, with tears of joy, read the letter and marvelled at the grace of the Lord. He paraded Paanapaththiran through the streets upon a royal elephant, and offered his entire vault of valuables as gift. 

Paanapaththiran refused and asked only for a small amount, what he needed to stay out of poverty. The King happily gave everything he asked for and sent Paanapaththiran back to Madurai, where, like the previous time, he gave all the gifts away again!
